<p>
Function ID is an analyzer that performs function identification analysis on a program. For each
function, the analyzer computes a hash of its body and uses this as a key to look up matching
functions in an indexed database of known software. The recovered function name,
and other meta-data about the <span class="emphasis"><em>library</em></span> it is contained in, is applied to the program.
</p>
<p>
Function ID is suitable for identifying statically linked libraries or other software
where the compiled form of the functions does not change. Because of the hashing strategy,
functions remain identifiable even if the library is relocated during linking.
Larger changes to the compilation process of the library however
will likely prevent successful searches.
Function ID databases are necessarily targeted to a specific processor.
</p>
<p>
Function ID generally runs as part of <span class="bold"><strong>Auto Analysis</strong></span> but can
also be initiated at any time
by the user from the <span class="bold"><strong>One Shot</strong></span> menu. Ghidra also comes
with a <a class="xref" href="FunctionIDPlugin.html" title="Function ID Plug-in"><i>Function ID Plug-in</i></a>, which provides more
control over which databases to apply, and allows users to create and populate their
own databases.
</p>
<p>
By default, Ghidra ships with databases that search for statically linked libraries
from Microsoft Visual Studio for the x86 processor. These have been broken apart into
separate Function ID databases, based on 32-bit or 64-code and the version of Visual Studio.
Within each database, there are a two library variants -- one for debug versions and one for production.
</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472630336"></a>Hashing</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
Function ID works by calculating a cumulative hash over all the machine <span class="emphasis"><em>instructions</em></span>
that make up the body of a function. For each function, two different 64-bit hashes are computed: a
<span class="bold"><strong>full hash</strong></span> and a <span class="bold"><strong>specific hash</strong></span>.
Both schemes hash the individual instructions of the function body in address order, but they
differ in the amount of information they include from each instruction.
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>full hash</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
        This hash includes the mnemonic and some of the addressing mode information
        from an instruction. Specific register operands are also included as
        part of the hash, but the specific value of constant operands are not.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>specific hash</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
        This hash includes everything used in the full hash but may also include
        the specific values of any constant operands. A heuristic is employed that
        attempts to determine if the constant is not part of an address, in which
        case the value is accumulated into the hash.
      </p></dd>
</dl></div></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Both hashes are used to identify matches in a database. The <span class="bold"><strong>full hash</strong></span>
is robust against changes due to linking; the <span class="bold"><strong>specific hash</strong></span>
helps distinguish between closely related variants of a function.
</p>

<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472620992"></a>Parents and Children</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
When Function ID examines a function, its parent and child functions are also considered
as a way of disambiguating multiple matches. For example, suppose two functions have identical
sequences of instructions, except they each call to a different subfunction. In this situation,
the full hashes of the functions will be identical, but the system will try to match the hash of one of
the two subfunctions, allowing it to distinguish between the two.
</p>

<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472619376"></a>Libraries</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
Within a Function ID database, functions are grouped into <span class="emphasis"><em>libraries</em></span>,
which are intended to be recognizable named software components
that get linked into larger programs. A <span class="bold"><strong>Library</strong></span> has the following meta-data.
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Name</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This is a general descriptive name for the library.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Version</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      If there is a formal version number for the library, this
      field will hold this value as a string.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Variant</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      Version information that cannot be encoded in the formal
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Version</em></span> field
      can be encoded in this field. This is used typically for 
      <span class="emphasis"><em>compiler settings</em></span>, which affect Function ID
      hashes but don't make sense in a version string describing the
      source code.
      </p></dd>
</dl></div></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Generally, the analyzer is able to report all three fields describing the
library for any function match it finds. In the case where a
database contains multiple versions of the same library, it's common for
a function to match into two or more libraries that differ in their
<span class="emphasis"><em>Version</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Variant</em></span> field. In this case,
the analyzer will still report a single match but will leave off the fields it
couldn't distinguish.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472607824"></a>Single Matches</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
A <span class="bold"><strong>Single Match</strong></span> for a function occurs under the following conditions:
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">The analyzer can narrow down potential matches to a single function name.</li>
<li class="listitem">The function does not already have an imported or user-defined name.</li>
<li class="listitem">The number of instructions in the function exceeds the <span class="emphasis"><em>instruction count threshold.</em></span>
</li>
</ul></div></div>
<p>
Even if there are multiple potential matches in the database, the first condition may still hold
because they all share the same base function name.
The second condition does not need to apply if the "Always apply FID labels" option is
toggled on (See <a class="xref" href="FunctionID.html#analysisoptions" title="Analysis Options">&#8220;Analysis Options&#8221;</a>). The number of instructions is computed as
the <span class="emphasis"><em>match score</em></span> and can include counts of instructions in parent or child functions.
For details about the match score and thresholds, see <a class="xref" href="FunctionID.html#scoring" title="Scoring and Disambiguation">&#8220;Scoring and Disambiguation&#8221;</a>.
</p>
<p>
If there is a Single Match, the analyzer will:
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">Apply the function name as a symbol.</li>
<li class="listitem">Insert a comment describing the matching library.</li>
<li class="listitem">Add a <span class="emphasis"><em>Function ID Analyzer</em></span> bookmark.</li>
</ol></div></div>
<p>
Both the inserted comment and bookmark will include the phrase "Single Match".
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="multiplematches"></a>Multiple Matches</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
If the analyzer is not able to narrow down to a single function name,
even after applying all of its disambiguation logic, then the reporting
behavior depends on the remaining match scores. If they are too small
the matches are deemed to be random, and nothing is reported at all.
Otherwise, a <span class="bold"><strong>Multiple Match</strong></span> is reported.
In this case, multiple symbols and comments will be inserted, one for
each remaining match, up to an arbitrary limit. All the
comments will contain the phrase "Multiple Matches".
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="analysisoptions"></a>Analysis Options</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
This analyzer appears under the heading <span class="bold"><strong>Function ID</strong></span>
in the dialog listing the standard analyzers whenever the user elects to auto-analyze
a new program upon import, or by selecting <span class="bold"><strong>Auto Analyze</strong></span>
under the Code Browser's <span class="bold"><strong>Analysis</strong></span> menu. From this dialog, users can
toggle whether the analyzer is active or not, and if
<span class="bold"><strong>Function ID</strong></span> is selected and toggled on, the dialog
presents some configurable options for the analyzer.
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Instruction count threshold</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This is the <span class="bold"><strong>primary threshold</strong></span> a potential
      match must exceed in order to be reported by
      the analyzer. This defends against
      <span class="emphasis"><em>false positives</em></span> caused by randomly matching
      small functions. Roughly,
      the score counts the number of instructions in the
      function plus instructions in any matching parent or child.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Multiple match threshold</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      In general for a single function, if there are multiple potential matches
      all with different names, this is a good sign that the matches are random,
      and the analyzer will not report a match. But if the match score exceeds
      this threshold, the analyzer will report a <span class="emphasis"><em>Multiple Match</em></span>.
      (See <a class="xref" href="FunctionID.html#multiplematches" title="Multiple Matches">&#8220;Multiple Matches&#8221;</a>)
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Always apply FID labels</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      If this toggle is on, the analyzer will report matches even if there is
      already an imported or user defined name for the function.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Create Analysis Bookmarks</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      The analyzer will only create bookmarks for matches if this toggle is on.
      This does not affect insertion of comments and symbols.
      </p></dd>
</dl></div></div>
<p>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="scoring"></a>Scoring and Disambiguation</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
The Function ID analyzer assigns a <span class="bold"><strong>match score</strong></span> to
each of the potential matches it discovers in its database. The score is used
both to filter matches which are too small to be significant and to disambiguate
between potential matches.
</p>
<p>
The basic unit of the score is a single matching instruction with no constant
operands, which receives a score of 1.0. Certain instructions, such as calls and
<span class="emphasis"><em>no operation</em></span> instructions are assigned a score of zero.
Constant operands, in the rare case that they match via the <span class="emphasis"><em>specific hash</em></span>,
contribute an additional 0.67 units per operand.
</p>
<p>
Once a potential match is discovered, it is assigned a score based on:
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">Instructions in the body of the function.</li>
<li class="listitem">Constant operands that match in the body of the function.</li>
<li class="listitem">Instructions in the body of any child function that also has a match.</li>
<li class="listitem">Instructions in the body of any parent function that also has a match.</li>
</ul></div></div>
<p>
Once scores are assigned, potential matches are filtered based on the
<span class="emphasis"><em>instruction count threshold</em></span> (See <a class="xref" href="FunctionID.html#analysisoptions" title="Analysis Options">&#8220;Analysis Options&#8221;</a>).
This helps prevent small functions that randomly match database entries
from being reported. Note however that a small
function can still be correctly reported if its parent or child functions also have matches,
increasing its overall score.
If there are still more than one potential match, the highest assigned score is
used to filter out matches with lower scores.
</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472572880"></a>Matching Function Names</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
If there are still multiple potential matches once thresholds have been applied to the
match scores, the remaining matches will be grouped based on function names. If
two potential matches share the same function name, they are grouped together.
If the remaining matches can all be placed into a group sharing a single name, the result will
still be reported as a "Single Match".
</p>
<p>
Function names are considered to match if their <span class="emphasis"><em>base</em></span> names match.
The base name is obtained by stripping off any namespace from the symbol plus any initial underscores.
If the name is mangled, an attempt is made to demangle it first, then namespace and
parameter information is stripped.
