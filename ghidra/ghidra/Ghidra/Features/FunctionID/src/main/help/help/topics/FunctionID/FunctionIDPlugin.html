<p>
The Function ID Plug-in allows users to create new (.fidb) databases.
A Function ID database is a collection of meta-data describing software libraries
and the functions they contain. It is searchable via a hash computed over the
body of unknown functions (See <a class="xref" href="FunctionID.html" title="Function ID"><i>Function ID</i></a>). The databases are self-contained
and can be shared among different users.
Using this plug-in, databases can be created, attached, and detached
from an active Code Browser, and a database
can be populated with function hashes from programs in the current Ghidra project.
</p>
<p>
A Function ID database may hold many distinct libraries. Within a single library, all
functions must come from the same <span class="emphasis"><em>processor model</em></span> as determined
by Ghidra's Language ID. Ideally, functions should come from a single software component,
all compiled using the same compiler and settings.
</p>
<p>
Functions for a single library can be ingested from multiple files, usually from a series
of <span class="emphasis"><em>object</em></span> files analyzed within a Ghidra repository. If the library
is spread across multiple files, accurate symbol information is necessary
to properly compute parent/child relationships.
</p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">

<p>
All plug-in functionality is accessible from the <span class="bold"><strong>Function ID</strong></span>
menu, under the main <span class="bold"><strong>Tools</strong></span> menu.
In order to access this menu, the tool must be configured to include the
Function ID plugin. To do this, from the Code Browser select
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><span class="bold"><strong>File -&gt; Configure</strong></span></div>
<p>
Then click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Configure</em></span> link under the
<span class="bold"><strong>Function ID</strong></span> section and check the box
next to "FidPlugin".
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="pluginfunctionality"></a>Plug-in Functionality</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
The Function ID plug-in provides the following actions under <span class="bold"><strong>Tools -&gt; Function ID</strong></span>.
</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="chooseactivemenu"></a>Choose active FidDbs...</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
This brings up a dialog that allows the user to select which Function ID databases
are active. By default, Ghidra ships with a set of databases and they are all initially
active.
</p>
<div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/ChooseActiveFidDbs.png" align="middle" width="400" height="400"></td></tr></table></div>
<p>
Once a database has been deactivated, it will no longer be used for matches in
subsequent analysis. The selections for which databases are active are saved
as a preference on a per-user basis.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="createemptyfid"></a>Create new empty FidDb...</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
This brings up a file chooser dialog that allows the user to create a new
Function ID database. This cannot be located under the Ghidra install directory
root, because Ghidra considers files under the root read-only. We recommend
ending this database with the extension .fidb for consistency, although not
strictly necessary. Newly created databases are attached
(which means "known" for the purposes of tracking) and initially active,
even though they contain no match entries.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="attachfid"></a>Attach existing FidDb...</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
This brings up a file chooser dialog that allows the user to attach an
existing Function ID database. This cannot be located under the Ghidra
install directory root, because Ghidra considers files under the root
read-only. Attached databases are saved in the user preference system,
and retain their active status across sessions of Ghidra.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="detachfid"></a>Detach attached FidDb...</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
This brings up a dialog that allows the user to detach an already-attached
Function ID database. None of the databases delivered with Ghidra can be detached;
they can only be deactivated (see <a class="xref" href="FunctionIDPlugin.html#chooseactivemenu" title="Choose active FidDbs...">&#8220;Choose active FidDbs...&#8221;</a>). Detaching a
database removes it from use in searching, and also causes the user preference
system to forget about the existence of this database.

this option brings up a dialog where users enter the information needed
to populate the database.

<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Library Version</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      The formal version string for the library.  This is frequently the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</em></span>
      syntax but can be anything provided to distinguish between different versions of the same library.

<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Library Variant</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      Any other string for distinguishing libraries that doesn't fit in the formal

      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Base Library</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This is an optional setting for cross-linking with an existing library already
      ingested in the database.  In the event that the user wants to incorporate parent/child
      relationships into this library from another related library, they can set this option
      to point at the other library. The library must already be ingested (from a previous use
      of this command) into the same database. The Function ID ingest process will match parents
      and children across the libraries via function symbols.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Root Folder</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This specifies the set of programs from which the new library
      will be populated. The user can select any subfolder in the current Ghidra project. The
      ingest process will recursively search through all programs beneath this folder and,
      for each program, will collect any functions it contains.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Language</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This is the required 4-field Ghidra Language ID (i.e. <span class="emphasis"><em>x86:LE:64:default</em></span>)
      specifying exactly what processor the new language will contain. While scanning during ingest,
      any program that does not match this program model will be automatically skipped.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Common Symbol File</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This is an optional parameter that provides a list of common function symbols to
      the ingest process. The parameter, if present, is a path to a text file that contains
      the list of function symbols, one per line. The ingest process excludes these functions
      from consideration as disambiguating child functions. (See <a class="xref" href="FunctionIDPlugin.html#falsepositives" title="False Positives">&#8220;False Positives&#8221;</a>)

</dl></div></div>
<p>
</p>
</div>
<p>
Once all fields have been filled, clicking <span class="bold"><strong>OK</strong></span> causes all selected
functions to be ingested for the new library. Depending on the number of programs and
functions selected, this process may take some time. Upon completion, the process will present
a summary window, containing ingest statistics and an ordered list of functions that were
most commonly called within the library. This list can be used to create a
<span class="emphasis"><em>Common Symbol File</em></span> tailored for the library.

<p>
All functions going into a single Function ID <span class="emphasis"><em>Library</em></span> must already be imported and analyzed
somewhere within a single Ghidra repository (shared or non-shared). Multiple libraries contained within
the same database can be ingested in different phases, but a single library must be written to the database
in a single pass. The ingest dialog (see <a class="xref" href="FunctionIDPlugin.html#populatedialog" title="Populate FidDb from programs...">&#8220;Populate FidDb from programs...&#8221;</a>) specifies a single subfolder as
the root for the library. The process acts recursively, so there can be additional directory hierarchy under the root,
but all programs to be included in the library must be under the one root.

<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472513952"></a>Analysis</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
All programs must be analyzed enough to have recovered the bodies of all the functions that are to be included
in the library. Generally, the easiest way to accomplish this is to run Ghidra's default auto-analysis.
If functions are spread across multiple programs, as is typically the case, users can run the
Ghidra's <code class="code">analyzeHeadless</code> command to analyze across the whole set. However, take note below of some
of the modifications to the default analysis that may be necessary to get good Function ID results.
</p>
<p>
Every function to be included must have a <span class="emphasis"><em>non-default</em></span> function name assigned. 
Function ID uses a function's <span class="emphasis"><em>primary symbol</em></span> for the name.
Symbols are typically imported from debug information, but any method for assigning
names, script based or manual, will work.  Any function that still has its default name,
<code class="code">FUN_00....</code>, currently will not be ingested. 
</p>
<p>
When performing auto-analysis in preparation for ingest, its best to disable the
<span class="bold"><strong>Function ID</strong></span> analyzer (and the
<span class="bold"><strong>Library Identification</strong></span> analyzer as well)
in order to avoid cross contamination from different databases. If the function symbols
are <span class="emphasis"><em>mangled</em></span>, be sure to turn off the <span class="bold"><strong>Demangler</strong></span>
analyzer. This lets the future database apply the raw mangled symbol to new programs during analysis, which
lets their <span class="bold"><strong>Demangler</strong></span> analyzer pass run with complete information. 
</p>
<p>
For an example of these sorts of modifications to the analysis process, see the file:
</p>
<div class="informalexample"><code class="filename">Features/FunctionID/ghidra_scripts/FunctionIDHeadlessPrescript.java</code></div>
<p>
This is designed to be passed to the <code class="code">analyzeHeadless</code> command as a pre-script option.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="falsepositives"></a>False Positives</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
A <span class="bold"><strong>false positive</strong></span> in the context of Function ID is a
function that is declared as a match by the analyzer but has the incorrect symbol applied.
As with any classification algorithm, it is generally not possible to eliminate this kind
of error completely, but with Function ID there are some mitigation strategies.
</p>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472502064"></a>Causes</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
False positives for the most part only happen with small functions.
There are two related causes with Function ID:
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Tiny Functions</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      If a function consists of only a few instructions, it can be
      matched <span class="emphasis"><em>randomly</em></span> if there are enough entries
      in the database. The fewer operations a function performs, the
      more likely an unrelated function is to do those exact same things.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Code Idioms</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      A set of functions that are effectively
      identical can have different names and be used in unrelated contexts.
      Functions such as <span class="emphasis"><em>destructors</em></span> are typical: one might
      check that a particular structure field is non-zero, and then pass that
      field to <code class="code">free</code>.  Another destructor may
      perform the exact same sequence, but was designed for a completely unrelated structure.
      </p></dd>
</dl></div></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In either case, Function ID can apply a symbol that is misleading for the analyst.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="idm140323472493552"></a>Mitigation via Threshold</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
All mitigation strategies, to some extent, trade-off false positives for
<span class="bold"><strong>false negatives</strong></span>, which are functions that should have
been reported by the Function ID analyzer, but aren't (because of some threshold or strategy).
</p>
<p>
Most false positives by far are due to tiny functions. Function ID minimizes these via the
<span class="emphasis"><em>instruction count threshold</em></span>.  Potentially matching functions with
too few instructions that don't exceed this threshold will simply not be reported by the analyzer.
</p>
<p>
For users experiencing too many false positives, the instruction count threshold
is the easiest thing to adjust. It is fully controllable
by the user as an Analysis option (See <a class="xref" href="FunctionID.html#analysisoptions" title="Analysis Options">&#8220;Analysis Options&#8221;</a>), and increasing
it will directly reduce the false positive rate, at the expense of missing some <span class="emphasis"><em>true</em></span>
matches whose scores now fall below the threshold.
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="specialmitigate"></a>Specialized Mitigation</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
The default instruction count threshold is a good starting point for any new database,
generally striking a reasonable balance limiting false positives without
eliminating too many true matches. But even for an optimal threshold,
there may be a small handful of functions in the new database (usually <span class="emphasis"><em>Code Idioms</em></span>)
that exceed the threshold and repeatedly cause the wrong label to be placed. Instead of increasing
the threshold to filter out <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> functions with these higher scores, it is
possible to turn on one of several mitigation strategies that target the offending database entries
directly. These strategies include:
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Force Specific</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      If this is set on an entry, the specific hash must match before the
      system will consider the entry as a potential match. This is useful when
      a code idiom contains a known constant that the full hash would usually miss.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Force Relation</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This is probably the most useful specialized strategy. It forces
      at least one parent or child match to be present before the system considers the base
      function as a potential match. So even if an idiom is big, this forces a search
      for an additional confirmation.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Auto Fail</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This is a strategy of last resort. If an obnoxious code idiom can't be
      eliminated any other way, this forces the particular database entry to
      never be considered as a match.
      </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Auto Pass</strong></span></span></dt>
<dd><p>
      This strategy is different from the others, in that it applies to function
      entries whose scores are slightly too <span class="emphasis"><em>low</em></span>.  
      If a low scoring function has an instruction sequence that is deemed unique enough,
      this strategy causes any potential match to automatically pass the threshold. 
      This provides an alternative to lowering the instruction count threshold to include
      a particular function.
      </p></dd>
</dl></div></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
These strategies can all be toggled for <span class="emphasis"><em>individual function records</em></span> in the database.
To do this manually from the Code Browser, the user needs to search for the specific records they want to
change using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Debug Search Window</em></span> and then make changes from its
<span class="emphasis"><em>Result Window</em></span>. For details see <a class="xref" href="FunctionIDDebug.html#debugsearch" title="Debug Search Window">&#8220;Debug Search Window&#8221;</a>.
</p>
<p>
Strategies can also be toggled by running a Ghidra script.
Within a script the basic instruction sequence looks like:
  </p>
<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
FidFileManager fidFileManager = FidFileManager.getInstance();
List&lt;FidFile&gt; allKnownFidFiles = fidFileManager.getFidFiles();
// Choose a modifiable database from the list
...
// Open a specific database
FidDB modifiableFidDB = fidFile.getFidDB(true);

// Toggle strategies based on the full hash of the function(s)
modifiableFidDB.setAutoFailByFullHash(0x84d01243dfb8b9cbL, true);
modifiableFidDB.setForceRelationByFullHash(0x4e0920960b48ae7eL, true);
modifiableFidDB.setForceSpecificByFullHash(0x5ef2f47ee7151243L, true);
modifiableFidDB.setAutoPassByFullHash(0x96a4a6fd5694523bL, true);
...
// Save and close the database
modifiableFidDB.saveDatabase("comment", monitor);
modifiableFidDB.close();
  </pre></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
FunctionID hashes for specific functions can be obtained with the <code class="code">FIDHashCurrentFunction</code>
script.
