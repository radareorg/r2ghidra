    The Decompiler plug-in is a sophisticated transformation engine
    which automatically converts the binary representation of
    individual functions into a high-level C representation. The
    Decompiler presents a view of a program which is interactive and
    dynamically updated as the user adds or makes changes to the
    annotations associated with the program. A Decompiler window
    maintains the correspondence between the C representation and the
    assembly representation displayed in the Code Browser window, to
    the extent possible. The window allows instant visual association
    and navigation between C language expressions and their
    corresponding assembly instructions.

  <title>Enabling the Plug-in</title>
  <para>
    The Decompiler is a full Plug-in within Ghidra and can be configured to be enabled or
    disabled within any particular tool. Default configurations will have the
    plug-in enabled, but if its disabled for some reason, it can be enabled from within
    a Code Browser by selecting the menu option
    <informalexample>
      <emphasis role="bold">File -> Configure</emphasis>
    </informalexample>
    Then click on the <emphasis>Configure</emphasis> link under the
    <emphasis role="bold">Ghidra Core</emphasis> section and check the box next to
    <emphasis role="bold">DecompilePlugin</emphasis>.

  <para>
    The window automatically decompiles and displays the function at the
    <emphasis>current address</emphasis>. The address is set typically by left-clicking in the Listing window,
    or invoking the <emphasis>Goto</emphasis> command (pressing the 'g' key) and manually entering
    the address or some other label, but the Decompiler window
    follows any type of navigation in the Code Browser, triggering decompilation of the new function
    being displayed.
  </para>
  <tip>
    Any change to the function or Program made while using Ghidra causes the window to automatically
    redecompile the function it is displaying, to incorporate the new information. Changes include (but
    aren't limited to):

  <title>Decompiler Concepts</title>
  
<section id="ConceptPcode">
  <title>P-code</title>
  <para>
    P-code is Ghidra's Intermediate Representation (IR) language. When analyzing a function,
    the decompiler translates every machine instruction into p-code first and performs its
    analysis directly on the operators and variables of the language. Output of the decompiler
    is also best understood in terms of p-code. This section presents the key concepts of
    p-code. For a more detailed discussion see the document "P-Code Reference Manual".
  </para>
  <sect2 id="ConceptAddressSpace">
    <title>Address Space</title>
    <para>
      P-code defines all data in terms of an address space. An <emphasis role="bold">address space</emphasis>
      is defined simply as an indexed sequence of bytes that can be read and written by p-code operations.
      For a specific byte, the unique index that labels it is called the byte's <emphasis role="bold">address</emphasis>.
      Each address space has a:
      <informalexample>
      <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	<listitem>
	    <emphasis role="bold">name</emphasis> - a formal name for the space
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <emphasis role="bold">size</emphasis> - the maximum number of bytes that can be addressed
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <emphasis role="bold">endianness</emphasis> - how groups of bytes are interpreted as integers
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </informalexample>
    </para>
    <para>
      For a p-code model of a specific processor, all elements of the processor state (including RAM, registers,
      flags, etc.) must be contained in some address space. The model will define multiple address spaces
      to accomplish this, and beyond the raw translation of machine instructions to p-code, the decompiler
      can add additional spaces. Address space definitions that are common across many different processors include:
      <informalexample>
	<variablelist>
	<?dbfo list-presentation="blocks"?>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><emphasis role="bold">ram</emphasis></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A space that models memory accessible via the processor's main data bus. Depending on
	      the architecture, different spaces might be substituted for <emphasis>ram</emphasis>,
	      such as separate <emphasis>code</emphasis> and <emphasis>data</emphasis> spaces.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><emphasis role="bold">register</emphasis></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A space that models the processor's general purpose registers.  Ghidra still uses
	      the standard names to refer to registers for the processor, but internally each register maps to a
	      specific address in this space.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><emphasis role="bold">unique</emphasis></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A space dedicated to <emphasis>temporary</emphasis> registers.
	      It is used to hold intermediate values when modeling instruction behavior, and the decompiler
	      uses it to allocate space for variables that don't directly correspond to the low level
	      processor state.  The name <emphasis>unique</emphasis> is reserved for this purpose and
	      is present in all processor models.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><emphasis role="bold">stack</emphasis></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A space that represents bytes explicitly indexed through a <emphasis>stack pointer</emphasis>.
	      This is an example of an address space added by the decompiler beyond what the raw processor
	      model defines.  The <emphasis>stack</emphasis> space is a logical construction representing the set of bytes a
	      single function might access through its stack pointer.  Each stack address represents
	      the offset of a byte in some underlying space (usually <emphasis>ram</emphasis>) relative
	      to the initial value of the stack pointer upon entry to the function. The stack space is
	      always referenced in the context of a single function, and in this sense, each function
	      can be viewed as having its own distinct stack space.

	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><emphasis role="bold">constant</emphasis></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      A special space for encoding constants in p-code.
	      For complete generality, even constants that the processor might manipulate are
	      assigned to their own address space.  For an address in the constant
	      space, the index itself represents the constant.

  <sect2 id="ConceptVarnode">
    <title>Varnodes</title>
    <para>
      A <emphasis role="bold">varnode</emphasis> is defined as a sequence of bytes in
      an address space.  It represents the storage for a single value (variable) being
      acted on by the processor.
      All manipulation of data by p-code operations occurs on varnodes.
      A varnode can always be represented as the formal triple:
      <informalexample>
	<code>(address space,offset,size)</code>
      </informalexample>
      Both <emphasis>offset</emphasis> and <emphasis>size</emphasis> are integer values
      specified in terms of bytes.
      The first two elements, address space and offset, taken together represent the
      <emphasis>address</emphasis> of the varnode.
    </para>
    <para>
      Varnodes by themselves do not necessarily have a data-type associated with them.
      The decompiler ultimately assigns a formal data-type, but at the lowest level of p-code,
      varnodes inherit one the building block data-types from the p-code operations that
      act on them:
      <informalexample>
	<itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	  <listitem>
	    <emphasis role="bold">Integer</emphasis>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <emphasis role="bold">Boolean</emphasis>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <emphasis role="bold">Floating Point</emphasis>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </informalexample>
      The integer data-type assumes a two's complement encoding in the endianness of the
      address space containing the varnode.  Similarly, the floating point data-type assumes
      an IEEE 754 standard encoding.  The precision of the integer or floating point value is
      determined by the varnode's size.  A boolean data-type assumes the varnode has a size
      of 1 byte and takes either a value of 0, for <emphasis>false</emphasis>, or a value of
      1 for <emphasis>true</emphasis>.
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="ConceptPcodeOps">
    <title>P-code Operations</title>
    <para>
      A <emphasis role="bold">p-code operation</emphasis> is defined as a formal operator,
      labeled by its <emphasis>opcode</emphasis>, acting on 1 or more varnodes as input and
      storing a result in at most 1 varnode. Each p-code operation is associated with an
      address, which is usually the address of the machine instruction from which the p-code
      operation was translated. As most instructions require more than one p-code operation
      to fully model it, a separate 1-up counter is used to distinguish p-code operations
      associated with the same address. Together the address and the counter are referred
      to as the operation's <emphasis role="bold">sequence number</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The formal opcodes break up into categories similar to many programming languages.

      <title>Operator Tokens</title>
    <para>
      Most opcodes naturally correspond to a particular C operator token,
      and in decompiler output, many of the operator tokens displayed correspond
      directly to a p-code operation present in the decompiler's internal
      representation.  The biggest exception are the <emphasis>Branching</emphasis>
      operations; the decompiler uses standard high-level language control-flow
      structures, like <emphasis>if/else</emphasis>, <emphasis>switch</emphasis>, and
      <emphasis>do/while</emphasis> blocks, instead of the
      low-level branching operations. But even here, there is some correspondence
      between operations and keywords in the high-level language.
    </para>
    <para>
      Operations in the <emphasis>Extension/Truncation</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>Floating Point Conversion</emphasis> categories tend to be
      represented as <emphasis>cast</emphasis> operations in the high-level language,
      and so don't have an explicit operator token representing them.  Many p-code
      operations share the same operator token, such as the integer and floating-point
      addition operations <emphasis role="bold">INT_ADD</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="bold">FLOAT_ADD</emphasis>. The high-level language distinguishes
      between them via the underlying data-type of the variables.

<section id="ConceptHighFunction">
  <title>The HighFunction</title>
  <para>
    A <emphasis role="bold">HighFunction</emphasis> is the collection of specific information
    produced by the decompiler about a function, referring to the root class in the Ghidra
    source which holds this information.
    The HighFunction is made up of the following explicit objects:
    <informalexample>
	<itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	  <listitem>
	    A <emphasis role="bold">control-flow</emphasis> representation of the function
	    in terms of <emphasis>basic blocks</emphasis>.
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    A <emphasis role="bold">data-flow</emphasis> representation of the function
	    in terms of <emphasis>varnodes</emphasis> and <emphasis>p-code operations</emphasis>.
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    A <emphasis role="bold">symbol-table</emphasis> of variables accessed by the function.
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
    </informalexample>
  </para>
  <para>
    The decompiler's output provides a standalone view of the function which is distinct
    from any annotations about the function that are present in the Program database
    and displayed in the Listing view (although the output may be informed by these annotations).
    The terms <emphasis>HighFunction</emphasis>, <emphasis>HighVariable</emphasis>, and
    <emphasis>HighSymbol</emphasis> refer to this decompiler specific view of the function.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="ConceptHighSymbol">
    <title>HighSymbol</title>
    <para>
	A <emphasis role="bold">HighSymbol</emphasis> is one of the explicit symbols recovered by the
	decompiler.  It is made up of a name and data-type and can describe either:
	<informalexample>
	  <itemizedlist mark='none'>
	    <listitem>
	      a formal <emphasis role="bold">parameter</emphasis> of the function,
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      a <emphasis role="bold">local variable</emphasis> of the function, or 
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      a <emphasis role="bold">global variable</emphasis> accessed by the function.
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</informalexample>
    </para>
    <para>
	An important aspect of HighSymbols is that they are distinct from 
	the standard Ghidra symbols stored in the Program database and are part of
	the decompiler's separate view of the function. When the decompiler displays
	declarations for symbols in its output for instance, it is displaying
	HighSymbols, which may not directly match up with database symbols.
	The decompiler is generally
	<emphasis>informed</emphasis> by annotations in the database and may
	copy specific symbols from the database into its view, but it is
	generally free to invent new symbols discovered during its analysis. 
    </para>
    <para>
	Various actions within Ghidra allow the user to <emphasis>commit</emphasis>
	specific HighSymbols to the database as a permanent annotation, but this
	does not happen by default.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="ConceptVarnodeSSA">
    <title>Varnodes in the Decompiler</title>
  <para>
    Varnodes are the central <emphasis>variable</emphasis> concept for the decompiler.
    They form the individual nodes in the decompiler's data-flow representation
    of functions and are used during all stages of analysis.  During the initial stages
    of analysis, varnodes simply represent specific storage locations that are accessed
    in sequence by individual p-code operations. The decompiler immediately converts
    the p-code into a graph based data-flow representation, called Static Single
    Assignment (SSA) form.  In this form, the varnodes take on some additional attributes.
  </para>
  <para>
    In SSA form, each write of an operation to a storage location defines a new varnode.
    Write operations at different points in the code to the same storage location, still
    produce different varnodes.  In this context, each varnode has a <emphasis>lifetime</emphasis>
    or <emphasis>scope</emphasis> within the function. The scope starts at:
    <informalexample>
	<itemizedlist mark='none'>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The <emphasis role="bold">defining</emphasis> p-code operation which has the
	      varnode as its output. <emphasis>Or</emphasis>
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The beginning of the function, if the varnode is an <emphasis role="bold">input</emphasis>
	      to the function.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
    </informalexample>
    The scope extends via control-flow to each p-code operation that <emphasis>reads</emphasis> the
    specific varnode as an operand.  The value of the varnode between the defining p-code operation
    and the reading operations does not change. The scope of a varnode can be thought of as a set
    of addresses within the function's body connected by control-flow.  The address of the defining
    p-code operation is referred to as the varnode's <emphasis role="bold">first use point</emphasis>
    or <emphasis role="bold">first use offset</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the decompiler output for a specific high-level language like C or Java,
    a varnode still has a <emphasis>scope</emphasis> and represents a variable
    in the high-level language only across this connected region of the code.
    A set of varnodes, with disjoint scopes, provides a complete
    description of a high-level variable that can be written to at more than one point
    in the function.
  </para>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2 id="ConceptHighVariable">
    <title>HighVariable</title>
    <para>
	A <emphasis role="bold">HighVariable</emphasis> is a set varnodes that, taken
	together, represent the storage of an entire variable in the high-level language
	being output by the decompiler.  Each varnode describes where the variable's
	value is stored across some section of code.
    </para>
    <para>
	There is generally a one-to-one correspondence between HighVariables and
	HighSymbols. HighVariables can be thought of as the detailed storage description
	of the high-level variable, while the HighSymbol provides its name and data-type.
	However, there are some technical caveats to this correspondence to keep in mind.
    </para>
    <para>
	A HighVariable always describes <emphasis>explicit</emphasis> manipulation of
	data by instructions in the function.  In some cases, a HighVariable may only describe part
	of the storage for a HighSymbol. Particularly for structured or composite data-types, a
	function may operate on different parts of the variable at different points of the code,
	so a HighVariable may only encompass one field of the structure.
    </para>
    <para>
	A symbol may be referenced in a function, but the symbol's value may not be explicitly
	manipulated.  Constant pointers may refer to variables either
	on the stack or in main memory, but the variable's value is neither read nor written
	within the function. In this case, the HighSymbol exists, but there
	is no corresponding HighVariable.
    </para>

    <sect3 id="ConceptMerging">
	<title>Merging</title>
	<para>
	  <emphasis role="bold">Merging</emphasis> is the part of the analysis process where
	  the decompiler decides what varnodes get grouped together to create the final
	  HighVariables in the output.  Each varnode's scope (see the discussion in
	  <xref linkend="ConceptVarnodeSSA"/>) provides the fundamental restriction on this process.
	  Two varnodes cannot be merged if their scopes intersect.  But this leaves a lot of
	  leeway in what varnodes <emphasis>can</emphasis> be merged.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Certain varnodes must be merged; if they use the same storage but in different
	  control-flow paths that come together, for instance, or if it is explicitly
	  known that the varnodes must represent the same variable.  This is referred
	  to as <emphasis role="bold">forced merging</emphasis>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The decompiler may also merge varnodes that could just as easily exist as separate
	  variables.  This is called <emphasis role="bold">speculative merging</emphasis>.
	  In addition to the intersection condition on varnode scopes, the decompiler only
	  speculatively merges variables that share the same data-type. Beyond this, the decompiler
	  prioritizes variable pairs that are read and written within the same instruction and
	  then pairs that are "near" each other in the control-flow of the function.
	  To a limited extent, users are able to control this kind of merging
	  (See <xref linkend="ActionIsolate"/>).

      actually map these symbols to physical registers and memory locations, compilers establish a
      <emphasis>calling convention</emphasis> for the function.
      Loosely, this is a set of memory resources, whether it is registers or stack locations,
      and a procedure for sequentially assigning resources to parameters based on their properties.
      A <emphasis role="bold">prototype model</emphasis> is the formal object in Ghidra that represents
      a calling convention and holds its specific rules and resource details.
    </para>
    <para>
      Prototype models are architecture specific, and depending on the compiler, a single Program may make
      use of multiple models.  Subsequently, each distinct model has a name like <code>__stdcall</code> or
      <code>__thiscall</code>. The decompiler makes use of the prototype model, as assigned to the function by the user or
      discovered in some other way, when performing its analysis of parameters.
    </para>
    <para>
      A prototype model is typically used as a whole and is assigned by name to individual functions.  But some of
      the sub-concepts of the model may be relevant to reverse engineers.

      <title>Incoming and Outgoing Storage Locations</title>
      <para>
	A formal input parameter is always assigned a specific memory location to hold its value coming into the function.
	The storage location can be a register, a stack location, or other memory location.  The storage
	location may be reused later by other variables in the function; only the incoming value stored there is guaranteed

  <title>Machine Instructions</title>
  <para>
    Individual <emphasis role="bold">machine instructions</emphasis>
    make up the biggest source of information when the
    decompiler analyzes a function.  Instructions are translated from their
    processor specific form into Ghidra's IR language (see <xref linkend="ConceptPcode"/>),
    which provides both the control-flow behavior of the instruction and the detailed
    semantics describing how the processor and memory state is affected. The translation is controlled by
    the underlying processor model and, except in limited circumstances, cannot be directly altered
    from the tool. Flow Overrides (see below) can change how certain control-flow is translated,
    and, depending on the processor, context registers may affect p-code (see <xref linkend="AnnoteContextRegister"/>).
  </para>
  <para>
    Outside of the tool, users <emphasis>can</emphasis> modify the model specification itself.
    See the document "SLEIGH: A Language for Rapid Processor Specification".
  </para>
  <para>
    Decompiling a function starts by analyzing control-flow starting from the function's
    first instruction. Control-flow is traced to additional instructions using flow information
    from the underlying processor model.  All paths are traced through instructions with
    <emphasis>fall through</emphasis>, <emphasis>conditional jump</emphasis>, and other
    semantics until an instruction with <emphasis>terminator</emphasis> semantics is
    reached, which is usually a "return from subroutine"
    instruction.  Flow is not traced into called functions, in this situation.  Instructions
    with <emphasis>call</emphasis> semantics are treated only as if they fall through.
  </para>
  <para>
    An <emphasis role="bold">entry point</emphasis> is the address of the function's first instruction.
  </para>
  <para>
    A <emphasis role="bold">function body</emphasis> is the set of addresses reached by control-flow
    analysis (and the machine instructions at those addresses).
  </para>
  <sect2 id="AnnoteEntryPoint">
    <title>Entry Point</title>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>entry point</emphasis> address for a function plays a pivotal role for
      analysis using the Ghidra decompiler. Ghidra generally associates
      a formal <emphasis>Function Symbol</emphasis> and an underlying
      <emphasis>Function</emphasis> object at this address, which are the key elements that
      need to be present to trigger decompilation.
      (See <link xlink:href="help/topics/FunctionPlugin/Functions.htm">Functions</link>)
      The Function object stores the function body, parameters, local variables, and
      other information critical to the decompilation process.
    </para>
    <para>
      Function Symbols and Function objects are generally created automatically by a Ghidra
      analyzer when initially importing a binary executable and running auto-analysis.
      If necessary however, a user can manually create a Function object from the Listing window
      by using <emphasis>Create Function</emphasis> command (pressing the 'f' key), when the cursor
      is placed on the function's entry point.
      (See <link xlink:href="help/topics/FunctionPlugin/Functions.htm#Create_Function">Create Function</link>)
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="AnnoteFormalFunctionBody">
    <title>Formal Function Body</title>
    <para>
      When a function is created, Ghidra stores its function body as a set of addresses in the
      Program database. This <emphasis>formal</emphasis> function body delineates the function
      from all the other kinds of data within the Program and lets Ghidra immediately link addresses
      in the middle of the function to the entry point and the Function object.  Decompiler windows
      in particular use the formal function body to know which function to decompile in response
      to a navigation event to an arbitrary address.
    </para>
    <warning>
      The decompiler does <emphasis>not</emphasis> use the formal function body when it computes
      control-flow; it recomputes its own idea of the function body starting from the entry point
      it is handed.  If the formal function body was created manually, using a selection for instance,
      or in other extreme circumstances, the decompiler's view of the function body may not match
      the formal view. This can lead to confusing behavior, where clicking in a decompiler window
      may unexpectedly navigate the window away from the function.
    </warning>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="AnnoteFlowOverride">
    <title>Flow Overrides</title>
    <para>
      Control-flow behavior for a machine instruction is generally determined by its underlying
      p-code (see <xref linkend="ConceptControlFlow"/>), but this can be changed by applying a Flow Override.
      A <emphasis role="bold">Flow Override</emphasis> maintains the overall semantics of a branching instruction
      but changes how the branch is interpreted.  For instance, a <code>JMP</code> instruction, which traditionally
      represents a branch within a single function, can be overridden to represent a call to a new function.
      Flow Overrides are applied by Analyzers or manually by the user.
    </para>
    <para>
      The decompiler automatically incorporates any relevant Flow Overrides into its
      analysis of a function. This can have a significant impact on results. The
      types of possible Flow Overrides include:

  <sect2 id="CommentDisplay">
    <title>Display</title>
  <para>
    The decompiler collects and displays comments associated with any address in the
    formal <emphasis>function body</emphasis> currently decompiling.
    The comments are integrated line by line into the decompiled code, and an
    individual comment is displayed on the line <emphasis>before</emphasis> the
    line of code incorporating the instruction associated with the comment's
    address.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because a single line of code typically encompasses multiple machine instructions,
    there is a possibility that multiple comments at different addresses apply to
    the same line.  In this case, the decompiler displays each comment on its
    own line, in address order, directly before the line of code.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because the output of the decompiler can be a heavily transformed version compared
    to the original machine instructions, its possible that individual instructions
    no longer have explicit tokens representing them in the output.  Comments attached
    to these instruction will still be displayed in the decompiler output with the
    closest associated line of code, usually within the same basic block.
  </para>
  <para>
    By default, the decompiler displays only the <emphasis>Pre</emphasis> comments
    within the body of the function.  It also displays <emphasis>Plate</emphasis>
    comments, but only if they are attached to the <emphasis>entry point</emphasis>
    of the function. In this case, they are displayed first in the decompiler output,
    along with WARNING comments, before the function declaration.  Other comment
    types can be configured to display in decompiler output, by changing the
    decompiler Display options (See <xref linkend="CommentOptions"/>).
  </para>
  <warning>
    Unlike the Listing window, the decompiler does not alter how a comment is
    displayed based on its type.
    All enabled types of comment are displayed in the same way, on
    a separate line before the line of code associated with the address.
  </warning>

  <sect2 id="CommentUnreachable">
    <title>Unreachable Blocks</title>
    <para>
      The decompiler may decide as part of its analysis that individual
      <emphasis>basic blocks</emphasis> are unreachable and not display them in the output.
      In this case, any comments associated with addresses in the unreachable block
      will also not be displayed.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="CommentWarnings">
    <title>Warning Comments</title>
    <para>
      The decompiler can generate internal warnings during its analysis and will incorporate
      them into the output as comments in the same way as the user defined
      comments described above. They are not part of Ghidra's comment system however and
      cannot be edited.  They can be distinguished from normal comments by the word
      'WARNING' at the beginning of the comment.

    Variable annotations are the most important way to get names and data-types
    that are meaningful to the user incorporated into the decompiler's output.
    A <emphasis role="bold">variable</emphasis> in this context is loosely defined
    as any piece of memory that code in the Program treats as a logical entity.
    The decompiler works to incorporate all forms of annotation into its output

      In order to widely accommodate different use cases, Ghidra's symbol

      All variables belong either to a <emphasis>global</emphasis> or <emphasis>local</emphasis>

      Annotations created by applying a data-type directly to a memory location in the listing
      are automatically added to the formal <emphasis>global</emphasis> namespace.
      Ghidra can create other custom namespaces that are considered global in this sense, and
      renaming actions provide options that let individual global annotations be moved into
      these namespaces.
      Dialogs that are brought up in the context of a function, like the Function Signature Editor,
      create variable annotations that are local to that function.
    </para>
    <para>
      A global variable annotation forces the decompiler to treat the memory location as if its value

      at all points of the function body, generally at the same memory location.
    </para>
    <para>
      Local variables,
      in contrast, do not generally exist across the whole function, but come into scope
      at the instruction that first writes to them, and then exist only up to the last
      instruction that reads them.  The memory location storing a local variable
      at one point of the function may be reused for different variables at other points.
      This can cause ambiguity in how the decompiler should treat a given memory location used
      for storing local variables, which the user may want to steer. See the discussion

    <sect3 id="AnnoteForcing">
      <title>Forcing Data-types</title>
      <para>
	The decompiler performs <emphasis role="bold">type propagation</emphasis> as part of its analysis
	on functions. Data-type information is collected from variable annotations (and other sources),
	which is then propagated via data-flow throughout the function to other variables and
	constants where the data-type may not be immediately apparent.  
      </para>
      <para>
	With few exceptions, a variable annotation is <emphasis>forcing</emphasis> on the decompiler in the sense
	that the storage location being annotated is considered an unalterable data-type source.  During
	type propagation, the data-type may propagate to other variables,
	but the variable representing the storage location being annotated is guaranteed to have
	the given name and that data-type; it will not be overridden.
      </para>
      <warning>
	Users should be aware that variable annotations are forcing on the decompiler and may directly
	override aspects of its analysis.  Because of this, variable annotations are the most powerful way
	for the user to affect decompiler output, but setting an incomplete (or incorrect) data-type as
	part of an annotation may produce poorer decompiler output.
      </warning>
      <para>
	The major exception to forcing annotations is if the data-type in the annotation is <emphasis>undefined</emphasis>.
	Ghidra reserves the following names to represent formally undefined data-types:
	<informalexample>
	  <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	    <listitem><emphasis role="bold">undefined1</emphasis></listitem>
	    <listitem><emphasis role="bold">undefined2</emphasis></listitem>
	    <listitem><emphasis role="bold">undefined4</emphasis></listitem>
	    <listitem><emphasis role="bold">undefined8</emphasis></listitem>
	    <listitem>...</listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</informalexample>
	These allow annotations to be made even when the user doesn't have information about a variable's data-type.
	The number in the name only specifies the number of bytes in the variable.
      </para>
      <para>
	The decompiler views a variable annotation with an undefined data-type only as an indication of what name
	should be used if a variable at that storage address exists.  The data-type for the variable is filled in,
	using type propagation from other sources.
      </para>
      <para>
	For annotations that specifically label a function's formal parameters or return value, 
	the <link linkend="PrototypeSignatureSource">Signature Source</link> also affects how they're treated by the decompiler.
	If the Signature Source is set to anything other than <emphasis>DEFAULT</emphasis>, there is a forced
	one-to-one correspondence between variable annotations and actual parameters in the decompiler's
	view of the function.  This is stronger than just forcing the data-type; the existence (or not) of
	the variable itself is forced by the annotation in this case.  If the Signature Source is forcing and
	there are no parameter annotations, a <emphasis>void</emphasis> prototype is forced on the function.
      </para>
      <para>
	A forcing Signature Source is set typically if debug symbols for the function are read in during
	Program import (<emphasis>IMPORTED</emphasis>), or if the user manually edits the function prototype
	directly (<emphasis>USER_DEFINED</emphasis>).
      </para>
      <para>
	If an annotation and the Signature Source force a parameter to exist, specifying an
	<emphasis>undefined</emphasis> data-type in the annotation still directs the decompiler to fill in
	the variable's data-type using type propagation.  The same holds true for the return value; an
	<emphasis>undefined</emphasis> annotation fixes the size of the return value, but the decompiler
	fills in its own data-type.
      </para>
      <note>
	The decompiler may still use an <emphasis>undefined</emphasis> data-type to label a variable,
	even after type propagation.  If a variable is simply copied around within a function and there
	are no other substantive operations or annotations on the variable, the decompiler may decide the undefined
	data-type is appropriate.

  <sect2 id="AnnoteStorage">
    <title>Variable Storage</title>
    <para>
      Every variable annotation is associated with a single <emphasis>storage location</emphasis>, where the

      in the load image of the Program.  The storage location does not necessarily hold the value for that
      variable at all points of execution, and its possible for the variable value to be held in
      <emphasis>different</emphasis> storage locations at different points of execution.  The set of execution
      points where the storage location <emphasis>does</emphasis> hold the variable value is called the annotation
      <emphasis role="bold">scope</emphasis>; this is distinct from (but influenced by) the scope of the
      variable itself. The different types of storage location are listed below.
    </para>
    <sect3 id="VariableStorageImage">
      <title>Load-image Address</title>
      <para>
	A <emphasis role="bold">load-image address</emphasis> is a concrete address in the load image of the Program,
	typically in the <emphasis role="bold">ram</emphasis> address space. This kind of
	storage must be backed by a formal memory block for the Program, which typically corresponds to a specific
	program section (such as the <code>.text</code> or <code>.bss</code> section).  Because it is in the
	load image directly, an annotation with this storage shows up directly in the <emphasis>Listing</emphasis>
	window and can be directly manipulated there. In much of the Ghidra documentation, these annotations
	are referred to as <emphasis role="bold">Data</emphasis>. See the section
	<link xlink:href="help/topics/DataPlugin/Data.htm">Data</link> in particular.
      </para>
      <para>
	Although specific architectures may vary, generally a storage location at a load image address
	represents a formal <emphasis>global</emphasis> variable, and the annotation is in scope
	across all Program execution. For the decompiler, the storage location is treated as a
	a single <emphasis>persistent</emphasis> variable in all functions that reference it. Within a
	function, all distinct references to the storage location (varnodes) are merged. The decompiler
	expects a value at the storage location to exist from <emphasis>before</emphasis> the start of
	the function, and any change to the value must be explicitly represented as an assignment to
	the variable in decompiler output.

      <title>Stack Address</title>
      <para>
	A <emphasis role="bold">stack address</emphasis> is an address in the <emphasis>stack frame</emphasis>
	of a particular function in the Program.  Formally, a stack address is defined as an offset relative to the
	incoming value of the <emphasis>stack pointer</emphasis> and exists in the
	<emphasis role="bold">stack</emphasis> address space associated with the function. See the discussion
	in <xref linkend="ConceptAddressSpace"/>. A <emphasis role="bold">stack annotation</emphasis> then is a variable annotation
	with a stack address as its storage location. It exists only in the scope of a
	single function and the variable must be <emphasis>local</emphasis> to that function. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Within the <emphasis>Listing</emphasis> window, a stack annotation is displayed as part of the function header
	(at the entry point address of the function), with a syntax similar to:
	<informalexample>
	  <code>undefined4 Stack[-0x14]:4 local_14</code>
	</informalexample>
	The middle field (the <emphasis>Variable Location</emphasis> field) indicates that the storage location is on the
	stack, and the value in brackets indicates the offset of the storage location, relative to the incoming
	stack pointer. The value after the colon indicates the number of bytes in the storage location.
      </para>
      <para>
	Currently, the entire body of the function is included
	in the scope of any stack annotation, and the decompiler will allow only a single variable to exist
	at the stack address. A stack annotation can be a formal parameter to the function, but otherwise the
	decompiler does not expect to see a value that exists before the start of the function.
      </para>
      <para>
	The decompiler will continue to perform <emphasis>copy propagation</emphasis> and other transforms on
	stack locations associated with a variable annotation. In particular, within decompiler output,
	a specific write operation to a stack address may not show up as an explicit assignment to its variable,
	if the value is simply copied to another location.

    <sect3 id="VariableStorageRegister">
      <title>Register</title>
      <para>
	A variable annotation can refer to a specific <emphasis>register</emphasis> for the processor associated
	with the Program. In general, such an annotation will be for a variable local to a particular function.
	Within the <emphasis>Listing</emphasis> window, this annotation is displayed as part of the function header, with
	syntax like:
	<informalexample>
	  <code>int EAX:4 iVar1</code>
	</informalexample>
	The <emphasis>Variable Location</emphasis> field displays the name of the particular register attached to
	the annotation, and the value after the colon indicates the number of bytes in the register.
      </para>
      <para>
	For a local variable annotations with a register storage location, there is an expectation that the
	register may be reused for different variables at different points of execution within the function.
	There may be more than one annotation, for different variables, that share the same register
	storage location.
	An annotation is associated with a <emphasis>first use point</emphasis> that describes where
	the register first holds a value for the particular variable.  (See the discussion - <xref linkend="ConceptVarnodeSSA"/>)
	The entire scope of the annotation is limited to the address regions between the first use point
	and any points where the value is read. The decompiler may extend the scope as part of its
	<emphasis>merging</emphasis> process, but the full extent is not stored in the annotation.

      The input parameter and return value annotations of the function prototype, like
      any variable annotations, can be forcing on the decompiler.
      See the complete discussion in <xref linkend="AnnoteForcing"/>.
      But keep in mind:
    </para>
    <warning>
      The input parameters and return value are all forced on the decompiler as a unit based on the
      <emphasis>Signature Source</emphasis>. They are all forced if the type is set to anything
      other than <emphasis>DEFAULT</emphasis>; otherwise none of them are forced.
    </warning>
    <para>
      If the function prototype's annotations are not forced, the decompiler will attempt to discover the parameters
      and return value using the calling convention.  The prototype model underlying the calling convention
      dictates which storage locations can be considered as parameters and their formal ordering.
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="PrototypeCustom">
    <title>Custom Storage</title>
    <para>
      If there are parameter or return value annotations that do not agree with the calling convention that
      has been set, the function prototype is said to be using <emphasis role="bold">custom storage</emphasis>.
      Using the <link xlink:href="help/topics/FunctionPlugin/Variables.htm#Edit_Function">Function Editor Dialog</link>
      for instance, any storage location can be specified as a parameter, and a completely custom prototype
      can be built for the function.
    </para>
    <para>
      The decompiler will disregard the calling convention's rules in this situation and use the custom storage
      locations for parameters and the return value.  Other aspects of the calling convention, like the
      <emphasis>unaffected</emphasis> list, will still be used.

<section id="AnnoteMutability">
  <title>Data Mutability</title>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Mutability</emphasis> is a description of how values in a specific memory region
    (either a single variable or a larger block) can change during Program execution, based either on
    properties or established rules.  Ghidra recognizes the mutability settings:
    <informalexample>
    <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
      <listitem>Normal</listitem>
      <listitem>Constant - (read-only)</listitem>
      <listitem>Volatile</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>	
    </informalexample>
    Mutability affects decompiler analysis and can have a large impact the output.
  </para>
  <para>
    Most memory has <emphasis role="bold">normal</emphasis> mutability, meaning:
    the value at the memory location may change over the course of executing the Program, but for a given
    section of code, the value will not change unless an instruction explicitly writes to it.
  </para>
  <para>
    Mutability can be set on an entire block of memory in the Program, typically from the
    <link xlink:href="help/topics/MemoryMapPlugin/Memory_Map.htm#View_Memory_Map">Memory Map</link>.
    It can also be set as part of a single Variable Annotation.  From the Listing Window for instance,
    use the <link xlink:href="help/topics/DataPlugin/Data.htm#Data_Settings">Settings</link> dialog.
  </para>
  <sect2 id="MutabilityReadOnly">
    <title>Read-only</title>
    <para>
      The <emphasis role="bold">constant</emphasis> mutability setting indicates that values within
      the memory region are read-only and don't change during Program execution.  If a read-only variable is
      accessed in a function being analyzed by the decompiler, its constant value, if present in the
      Program's <emphasis>load image</emphasis>, replaces the variable within data-flow for the
      function.  The decompiler may propagate the constant and fold it in to other operations, which
      can have a substantial impact on the final output.
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="MutabilityVolatile">
    <title>Volatile</title>
    <para>
      The <emphasis role="bold">volatile</emphasis> mutability setting indicates that values within
      the memory region may change unexpectedly, even if the code currently executing does not directly
      write to it.  If a volatile variable is accessed in a function being analyzed by the decompiler,
      each specific access is replaced with a built-in function call, which prevents constant propagation
      and other transforms across the access. The built-in functions are named based on
      whether the access is a <emphasis>read</emphasis> or <emphasis>write</emphasis> and then the size
      of the access.  Within decompiler output, the first parameter to a built-in function is a symbol
      indicating the volatile variable.  The function returns a value in the case of a volatile read or
      takes a second parameter in the case of a volatile write.
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	  write_volatile_1(DAT_mem_002b,0x20);
	  X = read_volatile_2(SREG);

<section id="AnnoteConstants">
  <title>Constant Annotations</title>
  <para>
    Ghidra provides some ways to control how specific constants shown in disassembly are formatted or displayed.
    These annotations are attached to constants as operands of specific machine instructions. To the extent
    possible, the decompiler applies these annotations to the matching constant in the decompiler output.
    The constant may be transformed from its value in the original machine instruction during the decompiler's
    analysis.  The decompiler will follow the constant through simple transformations, but if the transformed
    is too far from the original value, the annotation will not be applied.  The transforms followed are:
    <informalexample>
    <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
      <listitem>Signed or zero extension</listitem>
      <listitem>Bitwise negation</listitem>
      <listitem>Integer negation - Two's complement</listitem>
      <listitem>Add or subtract 1</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </informalexample>
  </para>
  <sect2 id="ConstantEquates">
    <title>Equates</title>
    <para>
      Ghidra can create an association between a name and a constant, called an <emphasis role="bold">equate</emphasis>.
      The constant must be a constant operand of a specific machine instruction, and the equate
      is applied directly to the operand from the Listing Window using the
      <link xlink:href="help/topics/EquatePlugin/Equates.htm#Set_Equate">Set Equate</link> menu.
      Once applied, the equate's name is displayed instead of the numeric representation of the constant.
      Equates across the entire Program can be viewed from the
      <link xlink:href="help/topics/EquatePlugin/Equates.htm#Equate_Table">Equate Table</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      When analyzing a function, the decompiler attempts to follow any constant in the function with an attached
      equate to the matching constant in the final output.  If successful, the equate's name is printed instead of
      the numeric form of the matching constant. If the constant was transformed from its original value, the
      matching constant is printed as an expression, where the transforming operations are applied to the equate
      symbol (representing the original constant).
    </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="ConstantConversions">
    <title>Format Conversions</title>
    <para>
      Ghidra can apply a <emphasis role="bold">format conversion</emphasis> to override how an integer operand
      is displayed in a specific machine instruction.  Conversions are generally applied from the Listing Window using the
      <link xlink:href="help/topics/EquatePlugin/Equates.htm#Convert">Convert</link> menu option. When analyzing a
      function containing a machine instruction that has a format conversion applied, the decompiler will attempt
      to trace the constant to a matching constant in the final output. If successful, the format conversion is also
      applied to the matching constant.
    </para>
    <para>
      Conversions applied by the decompiler are currently limited to:
      <informalexample>
      <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	<listitem>Binary - 0b10100111</listitem>
	<listitem>Decimal- 167</listitem>
	<listitem>Hexadecimal - 0xa7</listitem>
	<listitem>Octal - 0247</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </informalexample>
      An appropriate header matching the format is prepended to the representation string, either "0b", "0x" or just
      "0".  The decompiler will not switch the signedness of the constant but preserves the signed or unsigned data-type
      as determined by analysis.
    </para>
  </sect2>
</section>

<section id="AnnoteRegister">
  <title>Register Values</title>
  <para>
    A <emphasis role="bold">register value</emphasis> in this context is a region of code in the Program
    where a specific register holds a known constant value.  Ghidra maintains an explicit list of these values for
    the Program (see the documentation for <link xlink:href="help/topics/RegisterPlugin/Registers.htm">Register Values</link>),
    which the decompiler can use when analyzing a function.
    A register value benefits decompiler analysis, especially if the original compiler was aware
    of the constant value, as the decompiler can recover address references calculated as offsets relative to the register
    and otherwise propagate the constant.
  </para>
  <para>
    A <emphasis>register value</emphasis> is set by highlighting the region of code in the Listing Window and then invoking the
    <link xlink:href="help/topics/RegisterPlugin/Registers.htm#SetRegisterValues">Set Register Values ...</link> command
    from the pop-up menu.  The beginning and end of a region is indicated in the Listing Window with
    <code>assume</code> directives, and regions can be generally viewed from the
    <link xlink:href="help/topics/RegisterPlugin/Registers.htm#Register_Manager">Register Manager</link> window.
  </para>
  <para>
    In order for a particular register value to affect decompilation, the region of code associated with the
    value must contain the entry point of the function, and of course the function must read from the register.
    Only the initial reads of the register are replaced with the constant value.
    The decompiler will continue to respect later instructions that write to the register (even if the
    instruction is inside the register value's region)
    If a register value's region starts in the middle of a function, decompilation is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    affected at all.
  </para>
  <sect2 id="AnnoteContextRegister">
    <title>Context Registers</title>
    <para>
      There is a special class of registers, called <emphasis role="bold">context registers</emphasis> whose
      values have a different affect on analysis and decompilation than described above.
    </para>
    <tip>
      <emphasis>Context registers</emphasis> are inputs to the disassembly decoding process and directly affect which
      machine instructions are created.
    </tip>
    <para>
      The value in a context register is examined when Ghidra decodes machine instructions from the underlying
      bytes in the Program. A specific value generally corresponds to a specific <emphasis>execution mode</emphasis>
      of the processor. The ARM processor <emphasis>T bit</emphasis> for instance, which selects whether the
      processor is executing ARM or THUMB instructions, is modeled as a context register in Ghidra.
      The same set of bytes in the Program can be decoded to machine instructions in more than one way,
      depending on context register values.
    </para>
    <para>
      Bytes are typically decoded once using context register values
      established at the time of disassembly. From Ghidra's more static view of execution, a context register holds
      only a single value at any point in the code, but the same context register can hold different values for
      different regions of code. Setting a new value on a region of the Program will affect any subsequent disassembly
      of code within that region.  
    </para>
    <para>
      If a context register value is changed for a region that has already been disassembled, in order to see
      the affect of the change, the machine instructions in the region need to be cleared, and disassembly needs
      to be triggered again.  See the documentation on the
      <link xlink:href="help/topics/ClearPlugin/Clear.htm#Clear_Code_Bytes">Clear Plugin</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Values for a context register are set in the same way as any other register, using the
      <link xlink:href="help/topics/RegisterPlugin/Registers.htm#SetRegisterValues">Set Register Values ...</link> command
      described above.  Within the
      <link xlink:href="help/topics/RegisterPlugin/Registers.htm#Register_Manager">Register Manager</link> window,
      context registers are generally grouped together under the (pseudo-register) heading, <emphasis>contextreg</emphasis>.
      For details about how context registers are used in processor modeling, see
      the document "SLEIGH: A Language for Rapid Processor Specification".
    </para>
    <para>
      Because context registers affect machine instructions, they also affect the underlying p-code and
      have a substantial impact on decompilation.  Although details vary by processor, context register
      values are typically established during the initial import and analysis of a Program and aren't changed
      frequently.

    <varlistentry id="AnalysisAliasBlocking">
      <term><emphasis role="bold">Alias Blocking</emphasis></term>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When deciding if an individual stack location has become dead, the decompiler
	  must consider <emphasis>aliases</emphasis>, pointers onto the stack that could
	  be used to modify the location within a called function.  One strong heuristic the decompiler
	  uses is; if the user has explicitly created a variable on the stack between the
	  base location referenced by the pointer and the individual stack location, then
	  the decompiler can assume that the pointer is not an alias of the stack location.
	  The alias is <emphasis>blocked</emphasis> by the explicit variable.
	  However, if the user's explicit variable is labeling something that isn't
	  really an explicit variable, like a field within a larger structure for instance,
	  the decompiler may incorrectly consider the stack location as dead and start removing
	  live code.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In order to support the exploratory labeling of stack locations, the user can use this
	  setting to specify what data-types should be considered blocking. The four options are:
          <informalexample>
            <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>

	  Selecting <emphasis>None</emphasis> is the equivalent of turning off the heuristic. Selecting anything

	  In this case, the decompiler inserts the warning "Control flow ignored unimplemented

  </para>
  <para>
    A decompiler window always displays one <emphasis>function</emphasis> at a time.
    The initial window that comes up in the Code Browser is called the <emphasis role="bold">Main</emphasis>
    window (See <xref linkend="MainWindow"/>), and it automatically decompiles and displays the function at the
    <emphasis>current address</emphasis>, following the user's navigation.  Other
    <emphasis role="bold">Snapshot</emphasis> windows can also
    be opened that show different functions at the same time (See <xref linkend="Snapshot"/>). But any window
    only shows one function at a time.
  </para>
  <para>
    Decompilation for a window is performed "on-the-fly". It automatically
    incorporates the most recent labels, data-types, comments, and other annotations applied by the user.  Any change
    to the Program annotations (renaming, setting data-types, etc.) automatically causes each window to redecompile
    its function.
  </para>
  <para>
    The time it takes to decompile a single function is generally proportional to the number of instructions that make
    up the body of the function.  Large functions may require a significant amount of time to decompile, and because
    decompilation is performed on-the-fly, closing a window or navigating away from a function
    runs the risk of losing results that took a long time to compute.
  </para>

<section id="DecompilerDisplay">
  <title>Display</title>
  <para>
    The window shows the decompiled output for the function associated with the window in C or some other
    high-level programming language.  The output is tokenized following conventions of the language. Possible
    token types include:
    <informalexample>
      <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	<listitem><emphasis role="bold">Data-type Name</emphasis></listitem>
	<listitem><emphasis role="bold">Variable Name</emphasis></listitem>

	<listitem><emphasis role="bold">Syntax</emphasis></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </informalexample>
  </para>
  <para>
    The type of token provides context for the pop-up menus, which can trigger
    highlighting, navigation, renaming, and other actions within the window.
  </para>

  <para>
    If the window starts to decompile but ultimately fails to complete the decompilation, due
    to an error or cancellation, it displays a brief description of what caused the failure
    instead of the normal output.  Decompilation may also successfully produce output but issue
    one or more warnings during the process.  These warnings are integrated into the output as
    source code comments starting with label <code>WARNING:</code>.  They occur either at the
    beginning of the function as part of the function header or at the point in the code directly
    associated with the warning. (See <xref linkend="CommentWarnings"/>)

      </guiicon>&#xA0;or selecting
    <emphasis role="bold">Decompile</emphasis> from the <emphasis role="bold">Window</emphasis> menu in the tool
    brings up the <emphasis>main</emphasis> window.  The main window always displays the function
    at the <emphasis>current address</emphasis> within the Code Browser and follows as the user navigates
    within the Program.  Any mouse click, menu option, or other action causing the cursor to move to a new
    address in the Listing also causes the main window to display the function containing that address.
    Navigation to new functions is also possible from within the window by double-clicking on function
    tokens (See <xref linkend="MouseActions"/>).
  </para>

  <sect2 id="CrossHighlighting">
    <title>Cross Highlighting</title>
    <para>
      The main window maintains a map between the individual variable and operator tokens displayed in
      the window and the machine instructions which correspond to them. This can give the user instant
      feedback about the correspondence between the decompiler and disassembly views of the function,
      and it is frequently useful to have both the Listing window and the Decompiler window side
      by side.  Clicking on tokens in the Decompiler window causes the Listing window to navigate
      to the corresponding instruction, and clicking instructions in the Listing window
      causes the Decompiler window to navigate to the corresponding line.  Highlighting a region of
      code in either window causes the corresponding region in the other window to be highlighted.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Variable Name</emphasis> and <emphasis>Variable Sub-field Name</emphasis> tokens
      map to the machine instruction which wrote to the variable at that point in function.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Operator</emphasis> tokens map to the machine instruction which performed that operation.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Function Name</emphasis> tokens, if they represent a call to another function, map to the
      machine instruction executing the call.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Comment</emphasis> tokens map to the machine address associated with the comment.
    </para>
    <warning>
      In general, the map between machine instructions and tokens is not one to one because the decompiler
      transforms its underlying representation of the function.
      An instruction may no longer have any operator that corresponds to it in the decompiled result.
      Tokens may be transformed from the natural operation of the machine instruction they are associated
      with or may represent the effect of multiple instructions.

  <para>
    Information suitable for debugging the decompilation process for
    the current function is collected and saved to an output file in
    XML format. A file chooser dialog is presented to the user to
    choose the output file. The file is useful when submitting bug reports
    about the decompiler as it is generally much smaller than
    the entire Program and only contains information specific to the
    function. Information is generated by performing the full
    decompilation of the function and collecting all the data and
    annotations required during the process, including instruction
    bytes, symbols, data-types, and other settings affecting
    decompilation.

    Commit the names of any local variables discovered during the decompiler's analysis

    not committed as part of the annotation, only the name and storage location.
  </para>
  <para>
    Parameters are not affected by this command, see <xref linkend="ActionCommitParams"/>.
    The purpose of the command is to synchronize the local variables in the
    decompiler's view of a function with the formal Variable Annotations in the disassembly view,
    without otherwise affecting the decompilation.  After executing this command, additional changes
    to local variable can be performed directly on the corresponding annotations in the Listing Window,
    using various methods (See <xref linkend="AnnoteVariables"/>).
    Data-types are not forced for new annotations, they are created with
    an <emphasis>undefined</emphasis> data-type, which allows the decompiler to refine
    its view of the variable's data-type as new information becomes available
    (See <xref linkend="AnnoteForcing"/>).

  </para>
  <para>
    In the absence of either <emphasis>imported</emphasis> or <emphasis>user defined</emphasis>
    information about a function's prototype, the decompiler performs its own analysis of what
    the prototype is, determining the storage location and data-type of all parameters and the
    return value.  This action commits this analysis permanently for the current function
    displayed in the window, creating a matching <emphasis>Variable Annotation</emphasis> for each input
    parameter and the return value. The new annotations will be displayed in the
    Listing Window as part of the function header, and the action effectively
    <emphasis>synchronizes</emphasis> the disassembly view and decompiler's view of the function prototype.
  </para>
  <para>
    Committed prototype information is used both when decompiling the function itself and when
    decompiling other functions that call it.
    The committed annotations are <emphasis>forcing</emphasis> on the decompiler, and it will
    no longer perform prototype recovery analysis for that function. The decompiler assumes the committed parameters,
    and only the committed parameters, exist and will not modify their data-types, with the
    exception of parameters that are explicitly marked as having an <emphasis>undefined</emphasis>
    data-type. The user must manually modify individual variables or clear the entire prototype
    if they want a change (See <xref linkend="AnnoteVariables"/>).

<sect2 id="ActionRemoveOverride">
  <title>Remove Signature Override</title>
  <para>
    Remove the overriding function prototype applied previously to the called function under the cursor.
  </para>
  <para>
    This action can only be triggered at <emphasis>call sites</emphasis>, where an overriding
    prototype was previously placed by the <xref linkend="ActionOverrideSignature"/> command. As with
    this command, users must select either the token representing the called function's name or the
    tokens representing the function pointer at the call site.  The action causes the
    override to be removed immediately. Parameter information will be drawn from the decompiler's
    normal analysis.
  </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ActionRenameFunction">
  <title>Rename Function</title>
  <para>
    Rename the function corresponding to the token under the cursor.
  </para>
  <para>
    The current function can be renamed by selecting the name token within the function's
    declaration at the top of the decompiler window, or individual called functions
    can be renamed by selecting their name token within a call expression.  
    This action brings up a dialog containing a text field prepopulated with the
    name to be changed. The current namespace (and any parent namespaces) is
    presented in a drop-down menu.  Editing the text field changes the <emphasis>base</emphasis>
    name of the function, and selecting within the drop-down menu allows
    the function to be moved into a parent namespace.
  </para>
  <para>
    A new or child namespace can
    be specified by prepending the base name with the namespace using the C++ '::'
    separator characters. Any namespace path entered this way is considered relative
    to the namespace set in the drop-down menu, so the <emphasis role="bold">Global</emphasis>
    namespace may need to be selected if the user wants to specify an absolute path. If
    any path element of the namespace does not exist, it is created.
  </para>
  <para>
    The change will be immediately visible across all references to the function
    (including in any Decompiler, Listing, and Functions windows).
  </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ActionRenameField">
  <title>Rename Field</title>
  <para>
    Rename the field currently under the cursor within its <emphasis>structure</emphasis>
    data-type definition.
  </para>
  <para>
    The action brings up a dialog prepopulated with the
    current name of the field.  Editing and confirming this dialog immediately changes the
    field's name in its corresponding structure definition. The dialog enforces unique field names.
  </para>
  <para>
    If the initial name looks like <code>field_0x..</code>, it may be that the field offset was
    discovered by the decompiler, and the field does not exist in the structure definition.
    In this case, a new field is created at that offset, with the new name and a data-type of "undefined".
  </para>
  <para>
    The change to the definition is visible globally
    throughout the Program, anywhere the data-type is referenced. Decompilation
    is triggered again to incorporate the new name, but the output is otherwise unaffected.
  </para>
  <para>
    Within a decompiler window, field name tokens are presented <emphasis>in context</emphasis>,
    showing how they are used within the code flow of the current function.
    Combined with <xref linkend="ActionAutoStructure"/> and
    <xref linkend="ActionRetypeField"/>, this action allows a
    <emphasis>structure</emphasis> to be created and filled in based on this context.
  </para>

<sect2 id="ActionRenameGlobal">
  <title>Rename Global</title>
  <para>
    Rename the global variable corresponding to the token under the cursor.
  </para>
  <para>
    This action brings up a dialog containing a text field prepopulated with the
    current name of the variable. The current namespace (and any parent namespaces) is
    presented in a drop-down menu.  Editing the text field changes the <emphasis>base</emphasis>
    name of the variable, and selecting within the drop-down menu allows
    the variable to be moved into a parent namespace.

    namespace may need to be selected if the user wants to specify an absolute path. If
    any path element of the namespace does not exist, it is created.
  </para>
  <para>
    The change will be immediately visible across all references to the variable,

  <para>
    Rename the local variable or parameter currently under the cursor.
  </para>
  <para>
    The action brings up a dialog prepopulated with the current name of the variable.
    Editing and confirming this dialog immediately changes the name, unless there is a
    conflict with another variable.
  </para>
  <para>
    Decompilation is triggered again to incorporate the
    new name, causing local variable declarations to be reordered and line breaks to
    change, but otherwise the the output is unaffected.
  </para>
  <para>
    Local variables and parameters presented by the decompiler may be invented on-the-fly
    and don't necessarily have a formal annotation in Ghidra
    (see <xref linkend="AnnoteVariables"/>). Performing this action on
    a variable will create an annotation if one didn't exist previously, which will
    generally be visible as part of the function header in the Listing window.
    A new annotation will <emphasis>not</emphasis> commit the data-type of the variable,
    and data-types applied later, and elsewhere in the function, can still propagate into
    the variable.
  </para>
  <para>
    Performing this action on a function parameter causes a formal annotation to be created
    for <emphasis>all</emphasis> parameters, although the names of any other parameters
    will not be changed.
  </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="ActionRetypeField">
  <title>Retype Field</title>
  <para>
    Change the data-type of the field currently under the cursor within its
    <emphasis>structure</emphasis> data-type definition.
  </para>
  <para>
    The action brings up a dialog prepopulated with the current data-type associated
    with the field.  The user can select any fixed length data-type in the Program,
    although selecting a larger data-type may cause an error if there is not enough room
    for it with other existing fields.
    Editing and confirming this dialog immediately changes the
    corresponding data-type definition.
  </para>
  <para>
    The change to the definition is visible globally throughout the Program,
    anywhere the data-type is referenced, and is <emphasis>forcing</emphasis>
    on the decompiler (see <xref linkend="AnnoteForcing"/>). Decompilation is triggered
    again, and the new data-type is propagated from the point of the field reference(s).
    Changes to the output may be large and indirect.
  </para>

  <title>Retype Global</title>
  <para>
    Change the data-type of the global variable currently under the cursor.
  </para>
  <para>
    This action brings up a dialog prepopulated with the current data-type of the variable.
    The user can select any fixed length data-type in the Program that matches
    the size of the variable. Editing and confirming this dialog immediately changes
    the data-type.
  </para>
  <para>
    The change is visible globally throughout the Program, anywhere the variable is
    referenced, and is <emphasis>forcing</emphasis> on the decompiler
    (see <xref linkend="AnnoteForcing"/>). Decompilation is triggered
    again, and the new data-type is propagated from the variable reference(s).

<sect2 id="ActionRetypeReturn">
  <title>Retype Return</title>
  <para>
    Change the data-type of the current function's <emphasis>return value</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    This action is only available from the data-type token in the function declaration, at the
    top of the decompiler's output.  It brings up a dialog prepopulated with the current
    data-type returned by the function.  The user can select any fixed length data-type in the Program.
    Editing and confirming this dialog immediately changes the data-type. If an annotation for
    the return value (named <code>&lt;RETURN&gt;</code>) did not exist previously, one is created.
  </para>
  <para>
    As input parameter annotations and the return value annotation must be committed as a whole
    (see the discussion of function prototype's in <xref linkend="AnnoteForcing"/>), if
    no prototype existed previously, this action also causes variable annotations for all
    input parameters to be created as well.  In this situation, the action is equivalent to
    <xref linkend="ActionCommitParams"/>, and a confirmation dialog comes up to notify the user.
  </para>
  <para>
    Setting a data-type on the return value using this action affects decompilation for the
    function itself and, additionally, any function that calls this function.  Within a calling
    function, the decompiler propagates the data-type into the variable or expression incorporating
    the return value at each call site.
  </para>

    will create an annotation if one didn't exist previously, which will generally be
    visible as part of the function header in the Listing window.
  </para>
  <para>
    Performing this action on a function parameter causes a formal annotation to
    be created for <emphasis>all</emphasis> parameters to the function, and the number
    of parameters and their memory locations become fixed.  If the annotation of another
    parameter did not exist previously, then its data-type is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    forced by this action.
  </para>
  <para>
    Data-type information applied to parameters using this action is especially impactful
    because it affects decompilation for the function owning the parameter and, additionally,
    any function that calls this owning function.

<sect2 id="ActionIsolate">
  <title>Split Out As New Variable</title>
  <para>
    Split a high-level variable so that the selected token becomes a new variable with the smallest
    possible range.
  </para>
  <para>
    The decompiler defines high-level variables in terms of <link linkend="ConceptVarnode">varnodes</link> that
    are merged together to produce the final variable.  Some merging is speculative, which reduces the
    number of variables overall, but is not strictly necessary for valid decompilation.  The merged
    variable can be represented with two or more variables that have a smaller range. See the
    documentation on <xref linkend="ConceptHighVariable"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    This command is only available if the selected token is part of a high-level variable that has
    been speculatively merged.  The part of the variable that is directly represented by the
    token is split out as its own variable, retaining the name of the original variable.
    Any other pieces become a separate variable with a new name.
