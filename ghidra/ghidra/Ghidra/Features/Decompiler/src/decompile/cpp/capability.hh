/// This uses the C++ static initializer feature to automatically \e discover
/// and register extension point. Code for an extension should provide
/// a class that derives from CapabilityPoint and overrides the initialize() method.
/// Additionally there should be a singleton static instantiation of this extension class.
/// The extensions are accumulated in a list automatically, then the decompiler engine
/// will ensure that the initialize() method is called on each extension, allowing it
/// to complete its integration.
