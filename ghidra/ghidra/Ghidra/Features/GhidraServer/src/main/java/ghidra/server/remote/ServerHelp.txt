Ghidra server startup parameters.
Command line parameters:
						[-ip <hostname>] [-i #.#.#.#] [-p#] [-n]
						[-a#] [-d<ad_domain>] [-e<days>] [-jaas <config_file>] [-u] [-autoProvision] [-anonymous] [-ssh]
						<repository_path>
						
 
   -ip <hostname> : identifies the remote access IPv4 address or hostname (FQDN) which should be 
   	                used by remote clients to access the server.
   	                 
   -i #.#.#.# : server interface IPv4 address to listen on (default will listen on all interfaces).
	
   -p# : base TCP port to be used (default: 13100) [see Note 1]

   -n   : enable reverse name lookup for IP addresses when logging (requires proper configuration 
          of reverse lookup by your DNS server)
   
   -a# : an optional authentication mode where # is a value of 0, 1, 2, or 4
         0 - Private user password
         1 - Active Directory via Kerberos.  Requires -d<your.ad_domainname.tld>
         2 - PKI Authentication
         4 - JAAS Authentication.  See also -jaas <config_file>
         
   -d<ad_domain> : the Active Directory domain name.  Example: "-dmydomain.com"
 
   -e<days> : specifies default password expiration time in days (-a0 mode only, default is 1-day)

   -jaas <config_file> : specifies the path to the JAAS config file (when using -a4), relative
                         to the ghidra/server directory (if not absolute).
                         See jaas.conf for examples and suggestions.
                         It is the system administrator's responsibility to craft their own 
                         JAAS configuration directive when using the -a4 mode.
   
   -u   : enable users to be prompted for user ID (does not apply to -a2 PKI mode)
   
   -autoProvision : enable the auto-creation of new Ghidra Server
                    users when they successfully authenticate to the server (-a1 and -a4 modes only).
                    Users removed from the authentication provider (e.g., Active Directory) will need to be
                    deleted manually from the Ghidra Server using svrAdmin command. 

   -anonymous : enables anonymous repository access (see svrREADME.html for details)
 
   -ssh : enables SSH authentication for headless clients

   <repository_path> : Required.  Directory used to store repositories. This directory must be dedicated to this 
                       Ghidra Server instance and may not contain files or folders not produced
                       by the Ghidra Server or its administrative scripts.
                       Relative paths originate from the installation directory
                       
The following VM arguments may be required:

	-Dghidra.cacerts=<cacerts-path>     (required for PKI mode only)
	
NOTES:
1. The server utilizes a total of 3 consecutive TCP ports starting with the 
   base port (default: 13100).  The wrapper.log can be examined for server 
   console output which will indicate the startup port assignments.
