    <H1>Docking Windows</H1>

	    <P>Ghidra tools provide various GUI components that allow users to view and manage
	    programs.&nbsp; The Docking Windows feature allows users to customize the layout of these
	    "Dockable" components within a Ghidra tool.</P>
	
	    <H2>The Basic Dockable Component</H2>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		    <P>The image below shows a tool with three <B><I>Dockable Components</I></B>:&nbsp; <I>Program
		    Trees</I>, <I>Listing,</I> and <I>Data Type Manager</I>.</P>

	<BR><BR>
    <P>Each component consist of several common parts:</P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	    <H3>Title Bar</H3>
	
		    <BLOCKQUOTE>
		      <P>The title bar is at the top of the component and displays the title of the window.
		      It also serves as a handle for dragging the component to other positions within the
		      tool. &nbsp;The title bar's color indicates whether the component has keyboard focus.
		      When the component has focus, the title bar is blue, otherwise it is gray. Only
		      one component can have focus at a time.</P>
		    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	    
	    
	    <H3>Local Toolbar</H3>
	
		    <BLOCKQUOTE>
		      <P>The title bar also serves as a local toolbar.&nbsp; It contains icons for actions that
		      apply only to this component. Hovering the mouse over an icon causes a tool tip to be
		      displayed. The tool tip give a hint as to what the action will do if you select the icon.
		      </P>
		    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	
	    <H3><A name="Local_Menu"></A>Menu Icon <IMG src="../../shared/menu16.gif" alt=""></H3>
	
		    <BLOCKQUOTE>
		      <P>The menu icon will appear if the dockable component has a local menu. &nbsp;As with the
		      local toolbar, the local menu item applies only to this component. Mouse click on the icon to
		      show the menu.</P>
		    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	        <H3><A name="Close_Window"></A>Close Icon <IMG src="../../shared/close16.gif" alt=""></H3>
	    
			    <BLOCKQUOTE>
			      <P>Select <IMG src="../../shared/close16.gif" alt=""> to hide the dockable component.
			      The component will be removed until you select the component's name from the 
			      tool's <I><A HREF="#Windows_Menu">Window</A></I> menu.  Some components, such 
			      as search results, are transient and are permanently removed when you close 
			      these components.</P>
			    </BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	        <H3>Work Area</H3>
	    
		    <BLOCKQUOTE>
		      <P>The work area contains the specific GUI component that is being managed.</P>

    <H2>Arranging Components</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><I>Docking Windows</I> allows users to arrange components into configurations that best
      fit their needs. There are three ways components can be arranged in a tool:&nbsp;</P>

      <OL>
        <LI><I><B>Docked with other components</B></I>: components are side-by-side (or top to
        bottom) with another component.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>Stacked with other components</B></I>: components share the same space and tabs
        are used to display them one at a time.</LI>

        <LI><I><B>In their own window</B></I>: a component can be placed in its own window.</LI>
      </OL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Moving Components</H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>

	      <P>Components can be rearranged by dragging them in various ways. &nbsp;To drag a component,
	      press and hold the left mouse button on the title bar of the component to be moved and begin
	      moving the mouse. &nbsp;The mouse cursor will change to indicate what will happen if the
	      mouse button is released at that location.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/invalid.png" alt=""> &nbsp; &nbsp;Invalid Location -
	      releasing here will cancel the drag operation.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/leftArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Will move the component to the
	      left of the component that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/rightArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; &nbsp;Will move the component
	      to the right of the component that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/upArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Will move the component above the
	      component that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/downArrow.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Will move the component below
	      the component that the mouse cursor is over.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/stack.png" alt=""> &nbsp; Will stack the component with
	      the component that the mouse is over, creating a tabbed pane effect.<BR>
	      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src="images/window.png" alt=""> &nbsp; &nbsp;Will place the component
	      in a new window.<BR>
	      </P>
	
	      <P><IMG src="../../shared/tip.png" border="0"> To get the arrow cursors to appear, move the
	      mouse near the inside edge of another component. &nbsp;To get the stack cursor, move the
	      mouse over the middle area of another component. &nbsp;To get the new window cursor, move the
	      mouse over the desktop. &nbsp;The Invalid location cursor will appear when the mouse is over
	      the component being moved.</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Resizing components</H3>
	  <BLOCKQUOTE>
	      <P>Docked components are separated by thin borders. &nbsp;When the mouse is moved over a
	      border which separates two docked components, the cursor will change to a resize <IMG src=
	      "images/resize.png" alt=""> icon. To change the relative size of the components, press the
	      left mouse button while over a border and drag the border in the appropriate direction.</P>
    	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	 <H3><A name="Renaming_Windows"></A>Renaming Components</H3>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		 <P>
		 	<b>Transient</B> components (e.g., search windows) can be renamed.  Right-click on 
		 	either the title bar or tab of a transient window and a popup menu item will
		 	appear that allows you to change the title of that component.  This can be useful
		 	when you wish to better identify search results when you have performed many 
		 	searches.
		 </P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Windows_Menu"></A>Windows Menu</H2>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>

	    <P>Each component currently loaded in the tool has a corresponding entry in the tool's
	    <I>Window</I> menu. The menu item for a component can be used to show a component that is
	    currently not visible. &nbsp;If the component is already showing, it will be brought to the
	    front (if it is behind some other component or windows) and the component will be made active
	    (have keyboard focus).&nbsp; Temporary windows such as search results are shown at the bottom
	    of the menu below the separator bar.&nbsp; Multiple windows of the same type are grouped into
	    sub-menus. &nbsp; For example the following snapshot of a window menu indicates there are
	    several search results windows open.</P>
