    <H1>Selecting</H1>

    <P>Selecting is the process of <A href=
    "help/topics/SetHighlightPlugin/Highlighting.htm">highlighting</A> all or portions of a program
    in order to perform a task (for example, modular analysis) on the selection. Selecting can be
    done manually in providers that support selection, like the <A href=
    "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm">Code Browser</A>. Selecting can be done based
    on subroutines, functions, or by following certain types of control flows in the program.</P>

    <P>Selections can be created manually within the Code Browser. There are also some predefined
    types of selections that are available from the tool <B>Select</B> menu. Each predefined type
    of selection exposes different characteristics of the program.</P>

    <P>To create a selection using one of the predefined methods via the menu item 
    <B>Select</B><I><B><IMG src=
      "../../shared/arrow.gif">SelectionType</B>.</I>    
    </P>

    <P>The <I><B>SelectionTypes</B></I> and their descriptions are as follows:</P>
