    <H1>Equates</H1>

    <P>
    An Equate is a string substitution for <A href=
    "help/topics/Glossary/glossary.htm#Scalar">scalar</A> (a numeric value) in any code unit (instruction
    operand or data).  For example, consider the instruction below:</P>

    <P style="margin-left:100px">
    		<TT>MOV R2, $0xb</TT>
    </P>

    <P>The scalar <I>$0xb</I> can be replaced with the string <I>BATTERY_FLAG_CRITICAL</I>.
    This will yield the following:</P>

    <P style="margin-left:100px">    
    		<TT>MOV R2, BATTERY_FLAG_CRITICAL</TT>
    </P>

    <P>The substitution of "BATTERY_FLAG_CRITICAL" for <I>$0xb</I> is called an equate. That is,
    <I>$0xb</I> is equated to "BATTERY_FLAG_CRITICAL". Note that the default choice for the new 
    equate application is your current location. "BATTERY_FLAG_CRITICAL" will
    replace the scalar value <I>$0xb</I> only at the current cursor location unless you choose a 
    different option. However, when replacing another scalar of the same value, 
    a list of previously declared Equates for that
    scalar value is presented.</P>

    <P>Scalars can only be equated to strings. The string can be of any length and may
    contain spaces and special characters. Duplicate equate names are not allowed.</P>
