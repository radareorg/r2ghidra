     Closing a program will remove the program from the Tool. The Tool will remain displayed but
    will display either another open program or be empty.</P>

    <P>If the program to be closed has changes and is open in only one tool, the user will be
    prompted to save the program.&nbsp; However, if the program is open in multiple tools, the user
    will not be prompted to save even if changes have been made. In other words, the only time the
    user will be prompted to save a program that is being closed is when it has been changed and is
    open only in one tool.</P>
