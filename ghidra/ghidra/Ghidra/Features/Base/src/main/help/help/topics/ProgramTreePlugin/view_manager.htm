    <P>Program Trees are used to organize programs into a tree structure. Nodes within the a
    program tree can be used to navigate to the corresponding address in the <A href=
    "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm">Code Browser</A>. Also, the program tree can be
    used to restrict the view (set of addresses) that are displayed in the <A href=
    "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm">Code Browser</A>. The <SPAN style=
    "font-weight: bold;">Program Tree Manager</SPAN> allows you to <A href=
    "#Create_Default_Tree_View">create</A> , <A href="#Delete_Tree_View">delete</A>, <A href=
    "#Rename_Tree_View">rename</A>, and <A href="#Close_Tree_View">close</A> program tree
    views.&nbsp;</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>A default tree has a fragment for each memory block in the program; the fragments are
      named the same as the memory blocks.</P>

      <P>When you bring up a Code Browser, the Program Tree Manager (the tabbed pane on the left
      side of the Code Browser) shows a default view with no program open. When you open a program,
      the Program Tree Manager will create a tab for each tree view that is in the
      program.&nbsp;When you re-open the project, the Program Tree Manager will show the view from
      when you last closed the project.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>You can create a new default program tree by selecting the <IMG src="images/layout_add.png"
      x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" border="0"> icon. A new tab is displayed with
      the default name of the view, "Program Tree." If a view named "Program Tree" exists, then the
      name has a one-up number appended to it to ensure the name is unique, e.g., "Program
      Tree(1)."</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>You can see a list of existing Program Trees in the Program by selecting the <IMG src=
      "images/preferences-system-windows.png" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" border="0"> icon. Select
      the program tree name from the popup menu; a tab is created in the panel for this tree, if
      one does not already exist. The selected tree becomes the current tree in the tabbed
      pane.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The icon&nbsp; <IMG src="images/locationIn.gif" border="0">&nbsp;
      is a toggle button that controls whether the fragment(s) that correspond to the location in
      the code browser should be selected in the Program Tree.&nbsp; <B>On</B> means to select the
      fragment(s) that contain the address of the location. While the button is <B>On</B>, the
      Program Tree will track the location in the browser by selecting the appropriate
      fragments.&nbsp; The toggle is <B>Off</B> by default.</P>
