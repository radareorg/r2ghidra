    <H1>References</H1>

    <P>Within Ghidra, the term "Reference" covers two very broad areas:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI><I>Forward References</I> from a data or instruction code unit to a memory, external,
      stack, or register location</LI>

      <LI><I>Back References</I> to a location of interest (e.g., code unit, variable, data-type,
      etc.).</LI>
    </OL>

    <H2>Forward References</H2>

    <P><I>Forward References</I> can be explicitly defined within the program, on data or
    instruction code units. This is accomplished during disassembly, auto-analysis or manually by
    the user. In addition, <I>Forward References</I> to function parameters and variables may also
    be inferred. Both explicit and inferred <I>Forward References</I> can affect the code unit
    rendering and XRefs (i.e., Back References) displayed within the CodeBrowser listing. The
    effect of <I>Forward References</I> on the rendering of code unit operands can be somewhat
    controlled by means of various Code Browser Options (see <A href=
    "help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowserOptions.htm#Operands_Field">Operands Field
    options</A>).</P>

    <P>Management capabilities for explicit <I>Forward References</I> is provided by the
    <B>ReferencesPlugin</B> and is discussed in detail within the <A href=
    "References_from.htm">Forward References help section</A>.</P>

    <H2>Back References</H2>

    <P><I>Back References</I> (also referred to as "<I>Location References</I>") include both the
    inverse of <I>Forward References</I>, and the identification of listing locations where
    specific data-types are utilized. The viewing of <I>Location/Back References</I> is provided by
    the <B>LocationReferencesPlugin</B> and discussed in more detail on the <A href=
    "help/topics/LocationReferencesPlugin/Location_References.html">Location References Dialog help
    section</A>.</P>
