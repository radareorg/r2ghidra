    <P>When you open a Project, your active project is <A href="Close_Project.htm">closed</A>; the
    project identified in the <I>Open a Ghidra Project</I> dialog will be opened.&nbsp; If the
    active project has been modified since it was last saved, Ghidra will prompt you to save the
    active project before closing it. The project window is restored with any <A href=
    "help/topics/Tool/Ghidra_Tool_Administration.htm#Plugins">plugins</A> it had when you last
    saved the project. Tools that were running when you last saved the project are launched;
    programs that the tools had open are opened. The last active <A href=
    "Ghidra_Front_end.htm#Workspace">workspace</A> from this project now shows up as the active
    workspace. Other <A href="Ghidra_Front_end.htm#ReadOnlyProjectDataPanel">viewed projects</A>
    are restored.</P>

    <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" border="0">Projects that were
    created using a release of Ghidra prior to 3.0 can be viewed only. You can drag the data from
    the old project to your current project.</P>

    <P>To open a project, choose it from a list of projects in the default project directory.
    &nbsp;If the project has been opened before, then the project will appear in the <A href=
    "Re-opening_a_Project.htm">Reopen</A> list. &nbsp;If the project is being shared by others, it
    may not reside in the default project directory. &nbsp;Use the browse button, on the <I>Open a
    Ghidra Project</I> dialog, to locate the target project.</P>

    <P>To open a project:</P>

    <OL type="1">
      <LI>From the Ghidra Project Window, select <B>File<IMG src="../../shared/arrow.gif" border=
      "0">Open Project...</B>. The <I>Open a Ghidra Project</I> dialog
      appears.</LI>
    </OL>

    <P align="center"><IMG src="images/OpenProject.png" border="0"></P>

    <OL start="2">
      <LI>The dialog box filter defaults to *.gpr (project file extension).&nbsp;Select the project
      from the <I>Open a Ghidra Project</I> dialog.&nbsp;</LI>
    </OL>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" border="0">The project name can be
      of any length.&nbsp; The name of the project has the same restrictions that the operating
      system imposes on file names.&nbsp; A Ghidra Project name must have the
      <B>.gpr</B> extension.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <OL start="3">
      <LI>Click the <B>Open Project</B> button. The selected project appears in the Ghidra Project
      Window. If you are opening a <A href=
      "help/topics/VersionControl/project_repository.htm#SharedProject">shared project</A>, Ghidra
      attempts to <A href="help/topics/VersionControl/project_repository.htm#ConnectToServer">connect
      to the Ghidra Server</A>.&nbsp;You may have to enter a password, depending on the type of
      user authentication the Ghidra Server is using.</LI>

      <P>If this were a shared project, the connection status button (<IMG src=
      "images/connected.gif" border="0">) would be displayed, indicating that the project was
      successfully connected to the server. If the project failed to connect to the server, the
      status button would appear as <IMG src="images/disconnected.gif" border="0">. 
      If the server comes up after you have opened the shared project, you can click
      on status button to attempt to connect to the server. You can still work offline in a shared
      project, however, you will not be able to do any check outs or check ins.&nbsp;</P>
