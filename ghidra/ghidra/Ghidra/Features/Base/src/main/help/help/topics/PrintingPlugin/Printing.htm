<h1><a name="Print"></a>Printing</h1>
   
<p>Ghidra includes printing support that allows disassembled code to be printed 
using the same formatting as the code browser.  Printing can be limited to 
the current view, the current selection, or code currently on the screen in
the code browser.  Printed code will appear with the same fonts, colors, and
spacing as code on the screen.</p>
   
<p>To Print:</p>
   
<ul>
  	   
  <ol>
  		<li>You can optionally specify page settings (paper size, orientation, 
			margins, etc.).  To do this, select File<img border="0" src="../../shared/arrow.gif">
 			Page Setup... from the code browser tool.</li>
  		<li>To print, select File<img border="0" src="../../shared/arrow.gif">
 			Print...</li>
  		<li>Select the content to print as well as other printing options in
			the dialog that appears.  Click "OK" when finished.</li>
  		<li>Select printer-specific options in the printing dialog that appears. 
 			Click "OK" to begin printing.</li>
  	   
  </ol>
   
</ul>
     
<p> </p>
  
<h2><a name="Page_Setup"></a><b><font size="5">The Page Setup Dialog</font></b></h2>
     
	<p>When page setup is selected from the File menu, the standard page setup 
	dialog is displayed.  The exact appearance of this dialog is platform dependent 
	and will vary based on the operating system used.  The above image is an
	example of how this dialog appears on Windows XP.</p>
	    
	<p>Generally, the page setup dialog will allow you to specify the paper size, 
	orientation, and margin.  Margins will automatically be adjusted to fit the 
	specified paper and printer.</p>
	     
	<p> </p>
   
<h2><b><font size="5">The Print Options Dialog</font></b></h2>
     
<center><img src="images/PrintOptions.png"></center>
     
	<p>When you select <b>Print</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, a dialog with basic options is
	displayed.  This dialog allows you to choose what to print, including whether
	to put headers and footers on each page.  You can choose to print the current
	selection (if there is a current selection), the code currently visible in
	the code browser, or all code in the current view.  You will be prompted
	later to choose specific page ranges.</p>
	    
	<p>The print options dialog also includes an option to print the code in monochrome.
	 When selected, this option will cause all text to be printed as solid black.
	 For printers that do not print color or do not produce good grayscale, it
	may be useful to enable this option.</p>
     
<p> </p>
   
<h2><b><font size="5">The Print Dialog</font></b></h2>
     
 </center>
     
	<p>Finally, the print dialog is displayed.  This generally allows you to select
	and configure the printer and choose copies and page ranges.  As with page
	setup, this dialog varies on different platforms.  The above example was
	taken with Windows XP.</p>
	      
	<p> </p>
   
<h2><b><font size="5">Printing</font></b></h2>
	    
	<p>Once printing starts, a task dialog is displayed showing current progress. 
	 You may notice that the progress meter seems to indicate that the same page 
	is printed multiple times even when only one copy is specified.  This is normal
	behavior.  The print job can be cancelled at any time by pressing the cancel
	button, although pages already sent to the printer cannot be stopped.</p>
