<h1><a name="Snapshots_Start"></a>Snapshot Views</h1>
<p>In previous versions of Ghidra, there were basically two types of
component views: <span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">main</span> </span>views
and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">subordinate</span>
views.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Main</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span>views are the primary working
views such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Listing</span>
view and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bytes</span>
view.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Subordinate</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>views,
such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Symbol Table</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Data Type Mangager</span>, show more
specific information and are complimentary to the information displayed
in the main views.&nbsp; The main views are <span
 style="font-style: italic;">connected</span> to each other - cursor
location
changes in one view cause the other views to follow along. <br>
</p>
<p>Ghidra main views now have corresponding <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Snapshot</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>views&nbsp; A snapshot
view is similar to its related <span style="font-style: italic;">main </span>view,
but it is disconnected.&nbsp; It does not respond to movements in
other views and navigating within a snapshot view does not cause other
views to move.&nbsp; The main view
can then navigate to other programs and locations, but the snapshot
view will remain at its same location unless the user navigates within
the
snapshot view. Most actions that work on a connected view also
work in its corresponding snapshot view.&nbsp; Each snapshot view has
its own <a href="help/topics/Navigation/Navigation.htm#Navigation_History">navigation
history</a>, while the connected views all share a single navigation
history.<br>
</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<h2><a name="Creating_a_Snapshot"></a>Creating a Snapshot View</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Snapshot views are created by first
viewing the desired information in the connected view.&nbsp; Views that
support snapshots will have the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create
Snapshot</span> action (<img alt="" src="images/camera-photo.png">) on the local toolbar.&nbsp;
Pressing this icon will create a snapshot view of the same type (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">a Code Viewer</span> will create a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Code Viewer</span> snapshot, a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Decompiler</span> will create a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Decompiler </span>snapshot, etc.)
configured exactly the same as the creating view.&nbsp; The main view
can then navigate to other programs and locations, but the snapshot
will remain at its same location unless the user navigates within the
snapshot view.<br>
</p>
<h2>Snapshot Views, Windows, and Actions<br>
</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Snapshot views can be docked with normal views or they can live in
their own windows.&nbsp; Global menu and toolbar actions have been
changed to accommodate snapshot views.&nbsp; Global actions now operate
on whatever component has focus (the component whose header bar is
colored blue).&nbsp; For example, if you have the connected <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Listing View</span> and a snapshot <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Listing View</span>, both docked in the
same window, global actions such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Go
to Next Instruction</span> will navigate the normal view if it has
focus or the snapshot view if it has focus.&nbsp; If neither has focus,
the action will be disabled.<br>
Note this is different from previous versions of Ghidra.&nbsp;
Previously, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Go to Next Instruction</span>
action would always navigate the (one and only)<br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Listing View</span>, even if, for
example, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Symbol Tree</span> has
focus.&nbsp; Now, if the <span style="font-style: italic;">Symbol Tree</span>
has focus, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Go to Next Instruction</span>
action is disabled.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Since global actions now work on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">active</span> component (the
component that has focus) within its window, many global actions can
appear in multiple windows.&nbsp; For example, the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">undo/redo</span> actions will appear in any
window containing a <span style="font-style: italic;">Listing View</span>,
a <span style="font-style: italic;">Decompiler View</span>, or a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Bytes View</span>.<br>
