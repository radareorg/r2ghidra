        <P>Attempts to open the selected file as a sub-file-system. If this operation succeeds, the
        node will turn into a folder with one or more children. If this operation fails, the node
        will remain a leaf node. This operation could fail for many reasons, but generally it fails
        because the node does not represent a valid sub-file-system.</P>

    <H2>How To Handle Unsupported File Systems</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>If you receive this message: <B>No file system provider for the selected file.</B><BR>
      <BR>
       It means one of the following two things:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>The file you attempted to open as a file-system is actually NOT a file-system</LI>

        <LI>GHIDRA does not have an implementation for that file-system</LI>
      </OL>

      <P>If the file does not really represent a file system, then you may want to try importing
      it.<BR>
      <BR>
       Otherwise new file-systems can easily be written by implementing the
      <CODE>ghidra.formats.gfilesystem.GFileSystem</CODE> interface.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Your Java JVM install may not have support for strong crypto currently installed.<BR>
        <BR>
         In order to fix this issue, you must install Oracle's "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
        Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"<BR>
