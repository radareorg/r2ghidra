    <H1><A name="Stack_Editor"></A> Stack Frame Editor</H1>

    <P>The Stack Frame Editor is used to modify a function's stack frame. Each component indicates
    either a stack variable or an undefined byte on the stack frame. The variables and undefined
    bytes are in ascending order by offset. The following illustrates the editor for a stack
    frame.<BR>
    </P>

    <DIV align="center">
      <IMG src="images/StackEditor.png" alt=""><BR>
    </DIV>

    <P>A Stack Frame Editor can be launched from the right mouse popup on a function or stack
    variable in the <A href="help/topics/CodeBrowserPlugin/CodeBrowser.htm">Code Browser</A>.</P>

    <P>The Stack Frame Editor is composed of the following:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><I>Edit Actions</I>: The icon buttons at the top of the editor are used to modify this
      stack frame. Each button has a different <A href="#Stack_Editor_Edit_Actions">edit action</A>
      associated with it. These allow the user to: apply changes, clear defined stack variables
      (changes them to undefined bytes), delete stack bytes, and change a stack variable data type
      to an array.<BR>
      </LI>

      <LI><I>Pull Down Menu</I>: The <IMG src="../../shared/menu16.gif" alt=""> icon at the top of
      the editor provides additional editor actions. These are: show the category path of a
      component's data type, edit a component's data type, edit the fields of a component, and
      apply a cycle group or favorite.<BR>
      </LI>

      <LI><I>Component Table</I>: The upper portion of the editor contains a table with the stack
      frame's stack variables and undefined bytes. Each component (or row) consists of its offset,
      length, data type, variable name, and comment. See the <A href=
      "#Stack_Editor_Component_Fields">Component Fields</A> section for more about these fields.
      The offset, data type, name and comment are editable fields. The data type's category can be
      determined by <A href="#Stack_Editor_Show_Component_Path">showing the data type category</A>.
      Stack variables can be <A href="#AddDataType">defined</A> or <A href=
      "#ReplaceDataType">modified</A> in the table using <A href="#DragNDrop">Drag and Drop</A> or
      by applying a <A href="#Stack_Editor_Favorite">Favorite</A> data type. The data type for a
      stack variable can also be changed by <A href="#Stack_Editor_Cycle">cycling</A> the data
      type.</LI>

      <LI><A name="Stack_Editor_Frame_Size"></A> <A name="Stack_Editor_Return_Address_Offset"></A>
      <I>Stack Frame Information Area</I>: This is the area below the table with the stack frame
      size, return address offset, local size, parameter offset and parameter size for the stack
      frame. The <A href="#Stack_Editor_Local_Size">local size</A>, <A href=
      "#Stack_Editor_Parameter_Offset">parameter offset</A> and <A href=
      "#Stack_Editor_Parameter_Size">parameter size</A> can be modified here.</LI>

      <LI>Immediately below the stack frame information area is a status line where status messages
      will appear.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Apply_Editor_Changes"></A>Applying Changes</H2>

    <P>Select the Apply Changes icon <IMG src="images/pencil16.png" alt=""> in the toolbar to apply
    the changes from the editor back to the function's stack frame in the program.<BR>
    </P>

    <H2>Closing the Editor</H2>

    <P>Select the Close dockable component icon <IMG src="../../shared/close16.gif" alt=""> in the
    toolbar to exit from the editor. If you have unsaved changes to your stack frame, a dialog will
    ask if you want to save the changes.</P>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Local_Size"></A>Changing the Local Size</H2>

    <P>To change the local size of the stack frame, edit the <I>Local Size</I> field in the bottom
    of the editor. If the stack grows negative, changing this value changes the size of the
    negative side of the stack frame. Otherwise, it affects the positive side. Increasing the size
    will add undefined bytes to the stack frame. Decreasing the size will shrink the local variable
    side of the stack by removing bytes from the stack frame. If a local stack variable was defined
    where bytes are removed, it will also be removed.</P>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Parameter_Offset"></A>Changing the Parameter Offset</H2>

    <P>To change the parameter offset of the stack frame, edit the <I>Parameter Offset</I> field in
    the bottom of the editor. Changing the parameter offset will change the overall stack frame
    size. All parameters' offsets will be shifted so that they are the same relative distance from
    the parameter offset.</P>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Parameter_Size"></A>Changing the Parameter Size</H2>

    <P>To change the parameter size of the stack frame, edit the <I>Parameter Size</I> field in the
    bottom of the editor. If the stack grows negative, changing this value changes the size of the
    positive side of the stack frame. Otherwise, it affects the negative side. Increasing the size
    will add undefined bytes to the stack frame. Decreasing the size will shrink the parameter side
    of the stack by removing bytes from the stack frame. If a stack parameter was defined where
    bytes are removed, it will also be removed.</P>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Edit_Actions"></A>Edit Actions</H2>

    <P>The edit actions are available both from the icon buttons in the editor and from the popup
    menu for the component table. To display the popup menu, right mouse click on the component
    table. There are also short-cut keys associated with each of the edit actions.</P>

      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Editing the <I>Offset</I> Field</H3>

      <P>The offset field can be used to move a defined stack variable to a different offset. The
      variable will only be moved if it fits at the new offset and is allowable. Moving a variable
      from positive to negative stack space or vice versa is not allowed.</P>

      <H3>Editing the <I>DataType</I> Field</H3>

      <P>This can be any data type that is available in the data type manager. To edit the data
      type double-click the data type cell. This will show the <A href=
      "help/topics/DataTypeEditors/DataTypeSelectionDialog.htm">Data Type Selection Dialog</A>,
      which allows you to easily enter a data type. It can also be Undefined, a pointer to a data
      type, or an array.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P><B>Basic Data Type</B></P>

        <P>This can be a built-in data type (Byte, Word, etc.), a structure, a union, or a
        typedef.</P>

        <P>For example, Word.</P>

        <P><B>Pointer Data Type</B></P>

        <P>This can be the basic Pointer data type or a pointer to a data type. A pointer to a data
        type is indicated by following the data type with an *.</P>

        <P>For example, Word * is a pointer to a Word.</P>

        <P><B>Array</B></P>

        <P>This can be a multidimensional array of any data type.</P>

        <P>For example, DWord[2][4] is an array with 2 elements, where each element is an array
        with 4 elements that are DWords.</P>

        <P><B>Array of Pointers</B></P>

        <P>Arrays of pointers can also be specified.</P>

        <P>For example, Float*[5] is an array with five elements where each element is a pointer to
        a Float.</P>

        <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" alt=""> Pointers to arrays are not allowed. In other
        words it is not legal for the * to be to the right of the array dimensions.</P>

        <P>If the data type can be various sizes, like a Pointer or CString, then the user is
        prompted for the appropriate size.</P>

        <H4><A name="AffectOfChangingDataTypeSize"></A><U>Affect of Changing a Component's
        Size</U></H4>

        <P>The new component must be less than or equal to the original component's size plus any
        Undefined byte components that immediately follow it in the stack frame. Decreasing the
        component size will create Undefined byte components following it to maintain the stack
        frame size. Increasing the component size consumes Undefined bytes immediately following
        the component.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H3>Editing the <I>Name</I> Field</H3>

      <P>When specified, a stack variable name must be unique in this stack frame. It cannot
      contain blanks.</P>

      <H3>Editing the <I>Comment</I> Field</H3>

      <P>The comment can be any Ascii text.<BR>
      </P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Create_Pointer"></A>Pointers</H2>

    <P>Pressing the <B>p</B> key invokes the pointer action. This changes the selected component's
    data type into a pointer based on its previous type. If an Undefined is selected, it becomes a
    simple Pointer. If a Byte is selected, it becomes a Byte*, which is a pointer to a byte. If
    MyStructure[5] is selected, it becomes MyStructure[5]*, which is a pointer to an array of five
    structures. If the editor is unlocked and the empty last component is selected, a simple
    Pointer is added.<BR>
     If a default pointer size can't be determined, you are prompted for the size of pointer to be
    created. A pointer can be 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes. The maximum size of the pointer is restricted by
    the size of the current data type plus the number of Undefined bytes that follow it.<BR>
    </P>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Cycle"></A>Cycling a Component Data Type</H2>

    <P>Some data types are part of a cycle group. A cycle group is a collection of data types that
    are similar and are commonly associated with one another. Cycling a data type facilitates
    changing a component from one data type to the next data type in the same group. Each cycle
    group has a short-cut key associated with the group. Pressing the short-cut key cycles from the
    current data type to the next one in the group. For example, the <B>b</B> key is associated
    with the Byte cycle group. This group is Byte, Word, DWord, and QWord.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" alt=""> A single row of the component table must be
      selected to cycle a data type.</P>

        <LI style="list-style: none">
          <UL>
            <LI>If the component's current data type is not in that cycle group, the first data
            type in the cycle group that fits will be applied. For example, the <B>b</B> key will
            add a Byte; the <B>f</B> key will add a Float; the <B>apostrophe</B> key will add an
            Ascii.</LI>

            <LI>If the current data type is already in that cycle group, then the next data type in
            the cycle group that fits will be applied. For example, if the current data type is a
            Byte, pressing the <B>b</B> key twice would change it to DWord.</LI>
          </UL>
        </LI>
      </OL>

      <P>If Undefined bytes follow the selected component, the Undefined bytes can be replaced by
      cycling the data type to a larger sized data type. Likewise, cycling to a smaller data type
      will add Undefined bytes after the component being cycled.</P>

      <H3>Drag and Drop</H3>

      <P>Drag a pointer or fixed length data type to a row in the editor where there is an

      If the mouse pointer is a 'circle with a slash' then the data type cannot be dropped to
      replace the component. This happens because the data type being dropped won't fit at that
      offset in the stack frame or the data type is variable length (for example, "string"). When
      you drop a datatype it will consume the number of undefined bytes that is equal to its
      length. If you get a small rectangular box, then the data type can be dropped. Dropping the

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Show_Component_Path"></A>Showing a Stack Variable's Data Type
    Category</H2>

    <P>Every component has a data type: Byte, Word, Float, etc.. The category is where that data
    type is located. Since you can have two data types with the same name in different locations
    (categories), the editor provides a way to see the category for any component's data type.</P>

    <P>To see the category for a stack variable's data type:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Right mouse click on the stack variable in the table.</LI>

      <LI>From the popup menu, select <B>Show Component Path</B>.</LI>

      <LI>The category information appears in the editor's status line at the bottom of the
      dialog.</LI>
    </OL>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Edit_Component"></A>Editing a Stack Variable's Data Type</H2>

    <P>A Data Type Editor can be brought up from within the Stack Frame Editor for any component
    that is an editable data type, such as Structure, Union, or Enum.</P>

    <P>To display the editor for a stack variable that has an editable data type:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Select the component with a data type that is a structure, union or enum.</LI>

      <LI>Right mouse click on the component in the table. Select <B>Edit...</B> from the
      popup.</LI>

      <LI>The editable data type for the selected component is displayed in a new data type
      editor.</LI>
    </OL>

    <H2><A name="Stack_Editor_Show_Numbers_In_Hex"></A>Showing Numbers in Hexadecimal</H2>

    <P>The Component Table contains numeric fields which display that component's stack offset and
    length in the Stack Frame Editor. By default stack offsets and lengths are initially shown in
    hexadecimal. Numbers in the stack information area (such as Frame Size, Return Address Offset,
    Local Size, Parameter Offset, and Parameter Size) are also shown in hexadecimal by default.
    There is a <A href="#StackEditorToolOptions">tool option</A>, <B>Show Numbers In Hex</B>, that
    lets you override the default and set whether numbers should be displayed in hexadecimal when
    an editor is intially displayed.</P>

    <P>There is also a toolbar menu item in the Stack Frame Editor that allows you to immediately
    change whether the numbers are displayed in hexadecimal or decimal. Changing this only affects
    the current editor where it is changed.</P>

    <P>To switch between hexadecimal and decimal display of numeric values in the current
    editor:</P>

    <OL>
      <LI>Right mouse click on the table.</LI>

      <LI>A check mark next to <B>Show Numbers in Hexadecimal</B> indicates that numbers are
      currently displayed in hex. If there is no checkmark, the numbers are currently shown in
      decimal.<BR>
      </LI>

      <LI>From the popup menu, select <B>Show Numbers in Hexadecimal</B>.</LI>

      <LI>The numbers being displayed will change from hexadecimal to decimal or vice versa. The
      check mark next to <B>Show Numbers in Hexadecimal</B> indicates whether the numbers are
      currently displayed in hexadecimal.</LI>
