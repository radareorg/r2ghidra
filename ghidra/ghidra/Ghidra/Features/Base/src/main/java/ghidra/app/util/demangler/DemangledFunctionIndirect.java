 * A class to represent a demangled function indirect.  A function indirect is
 * similar to a function pointer or a function reference except that it does
 * not have the start (*) for a pointer or ampersand (&amp;) for a reference, but
 * is still an indirect definition (not a regular function definition).  The
 * function indirect is prevalent in the Microsoft model, if not other models.
