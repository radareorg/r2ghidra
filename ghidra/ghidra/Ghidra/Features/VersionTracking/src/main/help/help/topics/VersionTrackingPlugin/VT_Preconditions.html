			<P>
			One of the first items you run across in the Version Tracking Wizard is the 
			Precondition Panel. 
			***Put picture here****
        	It is an important initial step in the Version Tracking process. In the past, users
        	trying to match functions and pull relevant "mark-up" such as labels and comments into a
        	new version of a binary, would encounter problems if one or both of the binaries were not 
        	sufficiently analyzed or had major analysis problems. Users were given no indication that 
        	these issues were a direct result of having a poorly analyzed binary. The success or failure 
        	of the various preconditions are indicatiors of how well your binaries have been analyzed 
        	and how well their analyses "match" each other. If the preconditions indicates problems 
        	*** show and describe red x, warning, green check****, it is important to fix them before 
        	moving on or there will probably be problems with the Version Tracking process, such as 
        	identifying incorrect matches or failing to find valid function matches. In general, 
        	Version Tracking will work best if the same methods of cleaning up a binary are used and 
        	if similar numbers of functions are created.
