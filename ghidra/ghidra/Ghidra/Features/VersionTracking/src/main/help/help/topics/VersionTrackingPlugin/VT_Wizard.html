          <P>The new version tracking session panel appears when creating a new session only. On
          this page you specify the domain folder in your project in which to store the session
          information, the name of the session domain object, and the source and destination
          programs. The source program is the existing program that's been analyzed and contains
          markup to transfer. The destination program is the new program that will receive the
          markup items.</P>

          <P>When dragging two programs from the front-end onto the version tracking tool, the
          source and destination might not be properly identified. If they are backwards (source is
          destination, destination is source) simply press the "swap" button (<IMG border="0" src=
          "images/doubleArrowUpDown.png">) to correct the ordering.</P>

          large difference in the number of defined functions between the source and the
          destination programs could be an indication that they are not ready to be correlated.</P>

          <P>Press the button "Run Precondition checks", and then review the results in the panel
          by clicking on the individual tests in the list.</P>
