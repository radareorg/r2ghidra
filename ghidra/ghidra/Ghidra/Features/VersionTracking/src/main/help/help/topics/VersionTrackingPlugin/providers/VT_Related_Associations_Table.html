        <P>The <B>Related Matches</B> table is a dockable window that is available in both the
        Version Tracking Source Tool and Destination Tool. By default it appears as a small window
        in the bottom right corner of the tool. It shows a list of potential matches for the
        function or data where the cursor is currently located within the tool's listing. This
        match information is generated by the correlators chosen by the user.</P>

        <P>The <B>Related Matches</B> Table provides fields with the same information as those in
        the <A href="help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Matches_Table.html">Matches
        Table</A>. For a description of the table characteristics, see that table. The main
        difference between this table and the Matches Table is that this table only displays the
        matches related to the current function or data.</P>

          <P>In the Source Tool the <B>Related Matches</B> table shows all correlator or manually
          generated matches for the single function or data that is currently active in the Source
          Tool. Likewise the <B>Related Matches</B> table in the Destination Tool shows all
          correlator or manually generated matches for the single function or data that is
          currently active in the Destination Tool.</P>

          <P>The following image shows an example <B>Related Matches</B> table from a Version
          Tracking Source Tool.<BR>
          </P>

          <TABLE width="100%">
            <TBODY>
              <TR>
                <TD align="center"><IMG alt="" border="0" src=
                "../images/OneToManySource.png"></TD>
              </TR>
            </TBODY>
          </TABLE>

          <P>The information above the table indicates the name and address for the current tool's
          function or data. In the Source Tool if the cursor is within a function then the
          information above the table shows the current source function's name and entry point
          address. <I>In this case, our cursor is in the function <B>addPerson</B> in the Source
          Tool.</I><BR>
          <BR>
          The table itself contains a row for each of the matches (if any) for the current function
          or data. Each table row shows the name and address of each possible match in the
          Destination Tool, along with other match information. <I>In this case, correlators have
          found more than one potential match to the current function in the Source Tool. These
          matches might be entirely different functions or the same function but found with
          different correlators. In this example, the user decided that "addPerson" in the source
          program matched function <B>addPerson</B> in the destination program. It has already been
          accepted by the user as the correct match. Therefore both rows that indicate a match to
          the same destination function are marked accepted. By definition, there can only be one
          accepted match per function.</I></P>

          <P>The Destination Tool has its own <B>Related Matches</B> table. This has information
          for the function or data where the cursor is currently located in the Destination Tools
          listing. Each row of this table indicates a match to a source function. The following
          shows the related matches in the Destination Tool that are related to what was selected
          above in the Source Tool's table.<BR>

            </TBODY>
          </TABLE>

          <P><I>In this case the Destination Tool's cursor is in function <B>addPerson</B>. There
          are two matches displayed in the table which are to the same source address but were
          arrived at by different correlation algorithms.</I></P>

          <P>As you select various matches in either <B>Related Matches</B> table, the other
          (source or destination) tool will navigate to the function or data associated with the
          match. However, the selected match in the <B>Version Tracking Matches</B> table will
          remain the same. To force the selection in the <B>Version Tracking Matches</B> table to
          match selection in the <B>Related Matches</B> table, use this action. This action can be
          initiated as follows:</P>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>Select a match in the <B>Related Matches</B> table and do either of the
            following.</P>

            <UL>
              <LI>Click the toolbar button, <IMG alt="" border="0" src=
              "Icons.MAKE_SELECTION_ICON">.</LI>

              <LI>Right-click on a row in the <B>Related Matches</B> table to get a popup menu.
              From the popup menu choose <B>Select Match in VT Matches Table</B>.</LI>
            </UL>

            <P>Either of these will cause the same match to be selected in the Version Tracking
            Matches table. When the match becomes selected in the Matches table, the Markup Items
            table will update to show the items for that match and the markup items will be marked
            with colors in the listings.</P>
