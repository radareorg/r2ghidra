    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The goal of this document is to help users understand not only the basic process of
      Version Tracking, but also how and when to use the myriad of methods for tweaking that process to
      produce results tailored to individual user needs. The list below outlines the sections
      available in this document:</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>One of the first items you run across in the Version Tracking Wizard is the <A href=
        "help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/VT_Wizard.html#Preconditions_Panel">Precondition
        Panel</A>. This panel is described in more detail as part of the <A href=
        "help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/VT_Wizard.html">Version Tracking Wizard Help</A>.
        However, it is also mentioned here as an important initial step in the Version
        Tracking process. In the past, users trying to match functions and pull relevant <A href=
        "help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/Version_Tracking_Intro.html#Intro_Markup_Items">markup</A>
        such as labels and comments into a new version of a binary, would encounter problems if one
        or both of the binaries were not sufficiently analyzed or had major analysis problems.
        Users were given no indication that these issues were a direct result of having a poorly
        analyzed binary. The <B>Precondition Panel</B> is an indication of how well your binaries
        have been analyzed and how well their analyses "match" each other. If this panel indicates
        problems, it is important to fix them before moving on or there will probably be problems
        with the Version Tracking process. Problems that might be encountered are missing matches
        and incorrect matches. In general, Version Tracking will work best if the same methods of
        cleaning up a binary are used and if similar numbers of functions are created.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <H2><A name="Correlators"></A>Correlators</H2>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Once a binary has passed the precondition checks, a user must decide which correlator
        (Ghidra terminology for a matching algorithm) to use, what part of the binary to run each
        correlator on, and what to do with the matches once they are generated. Depending on the
        ultimate goal of the Version Tracking user, the work flow might be different. Some users
        might want to identify all matching functions and pull over all related markup items as
        quickly as possible. Others might want to quickly identify what has changed in the new
        binary. Others might want to only run Version Tracking on a select number of items they
        care about. The goal of this section is to help users learn how to determine which
        correlators best suit their individual needs.</P>

        <H3>What Correlator Should I Use First?</H3>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>One new feature of version tracking is the ability to sequentially run more than one
          correlator to find matching code and data and view their results simultaneously in the
          same Version Tracking Session. This ability to choose brings up the question of which to
          choose first. There are benefits to choosing certain correlators before others. In
          general, users should first run correlators that will find obvious matches and allow for
          automated matching and markup of a good portion of the destination program.</P>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

        <H4>Exact Correlators</H4>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Some of these "obvious" correlators are ones that find matches that are unique and the
          same in both binaries:</P>

          <UL>
            <LI><A href=
            "help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/VT_Correlators.html#Exact_Data_Match">Exact Data
            Match Correlator</A></LI>

            Function Instructions Correlator</A></LI>
          </UL>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>These correlators all report back unique and exact matches so it is almost assured that
          the matches are correct. Also, since they are identical in some way (bytes and/or
          instructions), the markup items, such as labels and comments, are going to line up
          correctly, allowing an automated pull of all markup at once. To automatically accept all
          of these items as matches and apply all related markup, the user can do a <B>CTRL-A</B>
          in the match table after making sure only the exact matches are in the table. Then, click
          on the <B>Apply Markup</B> <IMG src="images/checkmark_green.gif" border="0"> icon to
          accept all the matches and apply all related markup. If the two binaries are very
          similar, this can do the majority of the matching very quickly. <B>It is recommended to
          run these three exact correlators in this order before running any other
          correlators.</B></P>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>

        <H4>Symbol Match Correlator</H4>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Another one of the "obvious" correlators is the <A href=
          "help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/VT_Correlators.html#Symbol_Match">Symbol Match
          Correlator</A>. If you have unique matching symbols there is a high likelihood that the
          corresponding functions or data will be a match. However, it is not immediately apparent,
          without visiting them individually, whether these matches are exactly the same in both
          versions of the binary. The markup items such as labels, comments, data types, and
          parameters might not match up exactly so the user should use the <B>Accept</B> <IMG src=
          "images/flag.png" border="0"> icon to accept the matches, then if necessary, individually <A
          href="help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Markup_Table.html">visually inspect
          and apply the markup items</A>. In some cases, the user might not care about the markup.
          For example, if there are no user-generated markup items associated with the match, there
          is no reason to do anything other than "Accept" the match. Users might wonder why it is
          important to even accept a match for these items. One reason to accept matches, even if
          no markup needs to take place, is to help other correlators get better results. Some
          correlators use known accepted match information to make their decisions more accurate.
          Another reason is to save time. If there is an easy, quick way to identify matches, other
          correlators can ignore them and not waste time or memory trying to identify them.</P>

	          <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" border="0"> 
	          <B>NOTE:</B> It is also a good idea to check for wildly differing lengths between
	          matches in case there is the case where a wrapper function in one program has the same
	          name as the actual function in the other program. You can either take care of length
	          issues before running the correlator by making the length large enough to not include
	          wrapper functions, or use the resulting match table to inspect for different lengths. An
	          easy way to do this is to add the <B>Length Delta</B> column in the match table and sort
	          it. A delta of zero means there is no difference in the lengths. A high delta means there
	          is a big difference in lengths.</P>

        <H4>Duplicate Exact Correlators</H4>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Sometimes binaries will have more than one identical match. This often happens if
          there are multiple copies of strings or data in a binary. It also happens in functions
          that have the exact same instructions but different parameters. There are three
          correlators that find duplicate matches. These are:</P>

          <P>The user won't know right away which ones match. The <A href=

          Matches Tables</A> in the Source and Destination CodeBrowsers are useful for determining
          which matches are correct. Once the user determines the correct matches, the markup

        <H4><A name="Other Correlators"></A>Other Correlators</H4>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P>Once you finish determining the obvious matches you can run other correlators to find
          the rest of the matches. The availability of these other correlators depend on which
          version of Ghidra is available. Please
          refer to the individual help for these correlators for instructions on how to use them
          and how to incorporate them into a work flow process. In general these other correlators
          do not use "exact" methods of matching so it is important to be careful when accepting
          matches or applying markup.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>An Implied Match is a match that is found when a function match is Applied or Accepted
        and operand references in the matched functions apparently point to a matching function or
        matching data. For example, in the matched function pictured below, it is apparent that
        FUN_004011a0 in the Destination program is probably a match to the function addPerson. Also

        Table</A> below the matching functions, lists this function and string and several other
        references to strings as Possible Implied Matches. Users can use this table to make matches
        from Implied Matches. This will cause a match to be placed in the Match table with the type
        Implied Match. However, the user still has to accept or apply the match. There is also an
        <A href=
        "help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Apply_Options.html#Match_Accept_Options">Version
        Tracking Accept Match Option</A> to automatically generate Implied Matches whenever a
        function match is Applied or Accepted. The user still has to Accept or Apply the matches.
        The determination to use the automatic generation of Implied Matches or the Implied Match
        Table depends on how likely the match is to be correct and how closely aligned the match
        listings are. For matches found with the exact one-to-one correlators, it is relatively
        safe to turn on the auto option. For other correlators, it is safer to use the table.</P>

      <H3>What do the Scores and Confidence Columns Mean?</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The <B>Score</B> is an indication of how similar two potential matches are. For example,
        if two functions are matched with the Exact Function Bytes Correlator, the score will be
        1.0. The <B>Confidence</B> is an indication of how likely the two potential matches are
        actually a match. For example, if two functions are matched with the Exact Function Bytes
        Correlator, the Confidence will be 1.0 because this correlator only reports one-to-one
        matches. However, if two functions are matched with the Duplicate Exact Function
        Instruction Correlator, the Confidence value will be lower because this correlator reports
        two or more matches. Users should look at both of these indicators to help decide whether 
        to Accept, Apply, Reject, or Ignore a match.</P>

        <P><B>It is important to note that score and confidence values cannot be reliably compared
        between different correlators.</B> A confidence value of 0.8 for one correlator might be
        theoretically higher than a confidence value of 0.9 for another, because each correlator
        computes similarity and confidence differently.</P>

      <H3>How Do I Know Which Functions Have Not Been Matched Yet?</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Bring up the <A href=
        "help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Functions_Table.html">Window-&gt;Version
        Tracking Functions Table</A>. By default, two separate lists of functions from both
        programs are shown. To see which functions in both programs have no matches generated by
        any correlator so far, click on the black triangle and choose <B>Show Only Unmatched
        Functions</B>. To see which functions in both programs have no matches accepted by the user
        (includes functions with and without a correlator generated match) choose <B>Show Only
        Unaccepted Functions</B></P>

      <H3>Why Do I See The Same Match More Than Once in the Match Table?</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>If a match is found by more than one correlator, it will show up in the table for each
        correlator. This allows the user to gain more confidence in a match. It can clutter up the
        table, though, so users can filter the table based on algorithm and many other ways. See
        the <A href="help/topics/VersionTrackingPlugin/providers/VT_Matches_Table.html">Matches
        Table</A> help for more information on how to filter out information from the table.</P>

      <H3>What Part of the Binary Should I Run The Correlators On?</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>This is dependent on what the user is trying to do and which correlator is being run.
        Most correlators may be run on a subset of the binary. Others correlators must run on the
        entire binary. Those that allow subsets will give the user a choice when that correlator is
        chosen. If a user has specific items they are interested in finding matches for, they can
        run most correlators on those items only without seeing results for the entire binary.
        Other users want to match all possible items. Also, once items have been accepted by a
        user, users have the choice to ignore them on subsequent correlator runs. There are pros
        and cons to doing this. Pros include saving memory, compute time, and less clutter in the
        match table, although it can be filtered to remove the clutter. Cons include losing
        information about multiple correlator agreements or disagreements.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>This section lists common problems or things that should be avoided when version tracking
      programs.</P>

      <H3>Making Program Changes</H3>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>While version tracking two programs you should not make changes to either of the
        programs (aside from applying markup through the version tracking tool). Changing programs,
        especially the destination program, can cause the state of version tracking data (e.g.,
        matches and their markup) to be incorrect. If you need to make changes to either of the
        programs, then we recommend restarting the version tracking process from the beginning
        after your changes have been made.</P>
