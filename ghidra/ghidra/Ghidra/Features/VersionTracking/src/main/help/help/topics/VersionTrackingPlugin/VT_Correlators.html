      <P>A program correlator compares two versions of a program and generates matches between
      them. These matches are either functions (this function in the old version became this
      function in the new version), or data (this piece of defined data in the old is now here in
      the new version).</P>

      <P>Each correlator has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as characteristics for
      generating scores. For instance, some correlators may run better after already having run
      certain others (and processing their results). Some correlators return hard-coded scores due
      to the nature of their correlation. It is important to read the specifics of each
      correlator's description to understand how to best use it.</P>

      <P>Below is a list of built-in (i.e, not discovered) program correlators.</P>

        <P>Exact Data Match will iterate through your entire source program's list of defined data,
        and look for a 1:1 correspondence for this data in the destination program. For instance,
        if you have a defined string "This is a string" that appears only once in the source
        program, and the Exact Data Matcher finds a single area in the destination program with
        "This is a string", it will report it as a match.</P>

        <P>Exact Data Match reports 1.0 for similarity score (because by definition, the data are
        exactly the same) and 1.0 for confidence score (because it was found only once in each
        program).</P>

        <P>Duplicate Data Match will iterate through your source program's defined data, look for
        matches in the destination program, and only create matches if the correspondence is NOT
        1:1, i.e. 1:N, M:1, or M:N. Switch tables are often found by this correlator.</P>

        <P>Duplicate Data Match reports 1.0 for similarity score (because by definition, the data
        is exactly the same), but the confidence scores will all be less than 1.0. Duplicate Data
        Match uses 10/(total source and destination matches) for raw confidence, but due to the
        log<SUB>10</SUB> scaling of the confidence reporting column these values will always be
        less than 0.7<SUP>*</SUP>.</P>

        <P>Note that the data does not need to be defined in the destination program for these
        correlators to find matches.</P>

		        <P>Exact Function Instructions Match is almost exactly like Exact Function Bytes Match,

		        between a masked source function and a masked destination function, a match is created.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Legacy Import correlator is a legacy results file importer (and not really a
      correlator). It reads text files with a very specific format, and only creates functions
      matches based upon the contained data.</P>

      <P>The format of the file is a series of matches, each match on its own line. The match is
      comprised of 9 fields, each separated by whitespace. The 9 fields are as follows:</P>
<PRE>
        score (similarity, in the range [0.0, 1.0])
        source length (in bytes)
        destination length (in bytes)
        source program name
        source function name
        source address
        destination program name
        destination function name
        destination address
</PRE>

      <P><IMG src="../../shared/note.png" border="0"> NOTE: this format is provided for users who
      have existing results that absolutely positively can't see any way to get them into Version
      Tracking another way. It is legacy, deprecated, and will likely be replaced in the future
      with a new import format (most likely a legacy format -&gt; new data import format conversion
      tool will be released simultaneously). <B>We strongly recommend you don't use this importer,
      and instead start your Version Tracking analysis from scratch using our provided

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The "Implied Match" correlator is a placeholder for matches that were created based on
      references from other accepted matches. There is no "Implied Match" algorithm that can be
      run, but since all matches must have a correlator, the Implied Match correlator was created.
      Its only purpose is to display Implied Matches in the matches table. See the <A href=

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Exact Symbol Name Match is very similar to the Exact Data Match correlator and the Exact
        Function Match correlators, except it looks for symbol names. If there is an exact 1:1
        correspondence between a symbol name (after removing the _address suffix that is sometimes added to symbols) 
        in the source program and a symbol in the destination
        program, it will create a match. Note that this correlator only works on symbols where
        there is a defined function or defined data in the source program. For the function case,
        there also must be a defined function in the destination program. For the data case, there does
        not have to be defined data in the destination program. Also note that this correlator 
        ignores the default symbols that Ghidra automatically creates such as, but not limited to, those that
        start with FUN_, DAT_, except strings that start with s_, u_, etc...  Note: There is an option to 
        that allows users to find external symbol matches as well. </P>

        <P>Exact Symbol Name Match reports 1.0 for similarity score (because by definition, the
