// Format: LanguageID#CustomGDISExecutable
//
// Mapping of LanguageNameFromGhidra to external (gdis) architecture names is no longer done here.
// This functionality has been moved to each language's ldefs file.
// External names are mapped via 'external_name' tags in language definitions.
// The CustomGDISExecutable is found via a call to Application.getOSFile(), which will search in
// the platform-specific OS directory within all modules.
//
// Lines starting with "//" are not parsed.
//
// '*' can be used to wild-card parts of the languageID
//
