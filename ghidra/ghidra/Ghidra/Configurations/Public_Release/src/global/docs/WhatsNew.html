	<H1>Ghidra: NSA Reverse Engineering Software</H2>
    
    <P>
    Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by NSA's Research Directorate.
    This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable
    users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
    Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with
    hundreds of other features.  Ghidra supports a wide variety of process instruction sets and 
    executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes.  Users may also
    develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using the exposed API.
    </P>
    
    <P>
    In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems
    on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform.  NSA
    has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious
    code and generating deep insights for NSA analysts who seek a better understanding of potential
    vulnerabilities in networks and systems.
    </P>
    
    <BR />
    <H1> What's New in Ghidra 9.1</H1>
        
    <H2> <a id="finePrint91"/>The not-so-fine print: Please Read!</H2>
    
	<P>Ghidra 9.1 is fully backward compatible with project data from previous releases. However, programs opened in 9.1 may no 
	longer be accessible by an earlier Ghidra version if the processor model has been updated. </P>

	<P>This release includes many new features and capabilities, performance improvements, quite a few bug fixes, and pull-request
	contributions.  Many thanks to all those who have contributed their time, thoughts, and code. The Ghidra user community
	thanks you too!</P>

	<P>NOTE: The Ghidra 9.0 server is compatible with Ghidra 9.0 and 9.1 clients, however the 9.1 server
	now requires clients to use a TLS secure connection for the initial RMI registry port access.  
	If the Ghidra multi-user server is upgraded to 9.1, then all clients must
	upgrade to 9.1.  A 9.1 Ghidra client will fall back to a non-TLS connection when accessing the RMI Registry on
	a 9.0 server.  Note that all other server interaction including authentication were and continue to be 
	performed over a secure TLS connection.</P>
	
	<P>Minor Note: Ghidra-compiled .sla files are not backwards compatible due to the newly added OTHER space for syscalls
	support.  In the pre-built ghidra, all .sla files are re-built from scratch.  However if you have local processor modules,
	or are building ghidra from scratch, you may need to do a clean build.  You will get an error if an old .sla file is loaded
	without recompilation of the .slaspec file.  Any processor modules with changes are normally recompiled at Ghidra startup
	so this situation is rare.</P>
			
	<H2>Data Improvements</H2>
	
		<P>Bitfields within structures are now supported as a Ghidra data type.  Bitfield definitions
		can come from PDB, DWARF, parsed header files, and can also be created within the structure
		editor.  All Data type archives delivered with Ghidra have been re-parsed to capture bitfield
		information.  In addition, compiler bitfield allocation schemes have been carefully implemented.
		Full support for bitfield references within the decompiler is planned for a future
		release.</P>
		
		<P>In support of creating bitfields within structures, a new bitfield editor within the
		structure editor has been added.  The Bitfield Editor includes a visual depiction of the
		data type byte layout and the associated bits.  The BitField Editor simplifies the creation
		of bitfields within a structure.</P>
		
	<H2>System Calls</H2>
		<P>Ghidra now supports overriding indirect calls, CALLOTHER pcode ops, and conditional jumps via new overriding references.
		These references can be used to achieve correct decompilation of syscall-like instructions.  A new script,
		ResolveX86orX64LinuxSyscallsScript, has been provided as part of this initial implementation.
		Future releases will automatically identify and apply system calls for other operating systems and versions.</P>
		
		<P>To support system calls, the decompiler follows references into OTHER address space overlays.
		This allows users to create address spaces on the fly without worrying about conflicts with existing spaces.
		For example, instructions with a unique calling
		convention can be properly handled by adding a reference to a custom function signature.</P>
		
	<H2>Processor Specification</H2>
	
		<P>A new set of tools designed to make processor specifications easier to create, modify, and validate
		have been added.  The tools consist of a context sensitive Sleigh file editor, a pcode validation
		framework, an external disassembler field, and several scripts to make development easier.
		The Sleigh editor is a plugin for Eclipse and provides modern editor features such as syntax coloring,
		hover, navigation, code formatting, validation, reference finding, and error
		navigation.  The test suite emulates the pcode to automatically
		validate the instructions most commonly used by the compiler for that processor.</P>
		
	<H2>iOS DYLD and Macho Format</H2>
	
		<P>DYLD shared cache images, extracted from an iOS image, can now be imported in their entirety.
		A DYLD's embedded DYLIB's are split into memory blocks, greatly enhancing follow-on analysis.
		Internal Macho headers are retained and marked up similarly to ELF and PE files, which includes
		tracking the origin of the program bytes from the initial import binary.</P>

	<H2>Ghidra Server</H2>
	    <P>The Ghidra server now requires the client to use a TLS secure connection for the initial RMI registry port access.  
	    Previously, TLS was used for all remote object interactions and data transfers on the two other ports.  This change will 
	    now ensure that all connections to the Ghidra Server utilize TLS.
	    As noted above a 9.1 clients can connect to a 9.0 or 9.1 server, while clients prior to 9.1 will be unable to
	    connect to a 9.1 server.</P>
	    
	    <P>The Ghidra server has two additional authentication methods, Active Directory using
	    Kerberos and Plugable Authentication Modules (PAM) using JAAS.  To utilize these new
	    methods you must configure the server.conf file and use either -a1 for windows authentication
	    or -a4 along with -jaas.  The JAAS mode will require setup of an additional configuration file (jaas.conf).</P>
	
	<H2>Import</H2>
	    <P>When importing files, the origin of all imported bytes can be tracked back to their offset
	    within the original binary source.  This change lays the ground work for exporting back to the
	    original file after modifying the bytes. There are programmer API methods to get the bytes either
	    from the memory block or the underlying original source bytes.  To see the original bytes a memory
	    block can be mapped onto the original filebytes.  The source of each memory block within the memory
	    map is shown in a new Byte Source column. When hovering on the bytes in the program listing, the
	    origin of the bytes at that address are displayed.</P>
	    
    <H2>Decompiler</H2>
    	<P>The decompiler now implements a more detailed analysis of local variables on the
    	stack.  This change resolves many problems with disappearing
    	structure initialization and incorrect dead code removal. </P>
    	
    	<P>The decompiler now generates fewer duplicate assignments. For example, repeated assignment of
    	the same value to a variable in two branches will now appear
    	before either branch is taken.</P>
    	
    	<P>In addition the decompiler now recognizes more optimization patterns used
    	by compilers for signed division, resulting in simplified decompilation.</P>
    	
    	<P>AARCH64-based binary decompilation will be cleaner due to better handling of
    	zero extensions into larger registers.  This improves data flow analysis and
    	primarily affects functions using floating point Neon instructions.</P>
    	
    	<P>Renaming a parameter in the decompiler will no longer commit the
    	data types of all parameters, allowing data
    	types to continue to "float" without getting locked into a potentially
    	incorrect initial data type.  In addition, the cumbersome warning dialog
    	for renaming and retyping has been removed, improving your RE workflow.</P>

    <H2>Languages</H2>
    	<P>There are many new processor specifications including SuperH4, MCS-96,
    	HCS12X/XGATE, HCS08, and user-contributed specifications for MCS-48,
    	SuperH1/2a, and Tricore.</P>
    	
    	<P>The 16-bit x86 processor specification has been re-worked to include
    	protected mode addressing, which the NE loader now uses by default.  Handling of
    	segmented or paged memory has been updated to use a newer scheme, hiding its
    	complications from decompilation results. The implementation handles the HCS12X paging scheme as well.</P>
    	
    	<P>Many improvements and bug fixes have been made to existing processor
    	specifications: ARM, AARCH64, PIC, 68K, MIPS, PPC, JVM, Sparc, AVR8,
    	8051, 6502, and others.</P>
