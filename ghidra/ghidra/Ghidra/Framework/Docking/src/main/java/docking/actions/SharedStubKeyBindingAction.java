/**
 * A stub action that allows key bindings to be edited through the key bindings options.  This 
 * allows plugins to create actions that share keybindings without having to manage those 
 * keybindings themselves.
 * 
 * <p>Some ways this class is used:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>As a central action to manage key bindings for multiple actions from different clients 
 *      (plugins) that are conceptually the same.  When the plugins are loaded 
 *      these actions get registered and are wired to listen to key binding changes to this stub. 
 * 	</li>
 *  <li>As a placeholder action to manage key bindings for actions that have not yet been 
 *      registered and may not get registered during the lifetime of a single tool session.
 *      This can happen when a plugin has transient component providers that only get shown
 *      upon a user request.  This stub allows the key binding for those actions to be managed,
 *      even if they do not get registered when the tool is shown.
 *  </li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Clients should not be using this class directly.
