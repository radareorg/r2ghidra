/**
 * The base interface for clients that wish to create commands to be registered with a tool.
 * 
 * <p>An action may appear in a primary menu, a popup menu or a toolbar.   Further, an action 
 * may have a key binding assigned.
 * 
 * <p>The particular support for key bindings is defined by {@link KeyBindingType}.   Almost all
 * client actions will use the default setting of {@link KeyBindingType#INDIVIDUAL}.   To control
 * the level of key binding support, you can pass the desired {@link KeyBindingType} to the
 * base implementation of this interface.
 * 
 * <p>ActionContext is a key concept for tool actions so that they can be context sensitive if 
 * appropriate. The context provides a 
 * consistent way for plugins and components to share tool state with actions. Actions can then
 * use that context to make decisions, such as if they should be enabled or added to a popup menu.
 * The context information is also typically used when the action is invoked.  For example, an
 * action context from a table element may provide the row in a table component that is selected and
 * then a "delete table row" action can use that information to be enabled when a table selection 
 * exists and then delete that row if the action is invoked.
 * 
 * <p> To make the overall action experience more convenient for the user, action processing
 * supports the concept of a "default tool context".  This allows actions to work on a more global
 * level than just the component that is focused.  The idea is that if an action is not valid for
 * the current focused context (and it has be declared to work this way using 
 * the {@link #setSupportsDefaultToolContext(boolean)}), then it can be validated against the default 
 * tool context.  The "default tool context" is defined to be the action context of the tool's 
 * primary component.  This is primarily intended for tool-level actions which are the ones that appear
 * in the tool's main menu bar or toolbar.  This allows the tool actions to mostly work on the
 * tool's main component context regardless of what has focus, and yet still work on the  
 * focused component if appropriate (such as a snapshot of the main component).
