/**
 * A convenience context for transaction IDs on a Ghidra program database
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is meant to be used as an idiom in a try-with-resources block:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * try (ProgramTransaction t = ProgramTransaction.open(program, "Demo")) {
 *     program.getMemory().....
 *     t.commit();
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This idiom is very useful if there is complex logic in your transaction, it's very easy to forget
 * to close the transaction, especially if an error occurs, leaving the database in an open
 * transaction indefinitely. The try-with-resources block will ensure that the transaction is closed
 * in all circumstances. Note, however, that in order for the transaction to be committed, you must
 * call {@link #commit()}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any exceptions within the block will cause {@code t.commit()} to be skipped, thus aborting the
 * transaction.
