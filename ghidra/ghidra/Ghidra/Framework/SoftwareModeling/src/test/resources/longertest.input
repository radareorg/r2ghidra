@define FOO "def"
abc
@ifdef FOO
I'm in an ifdef!
@endif
@ifndef FOO
Exclude me, please!
@endif
@if FOO == "bar"
I'm not here.
@elif FOO == "def" # ignore this comment completely
I'm here.
@elif FOO == "def"
Guess what? this isn't here either because the thing
above handled this if block.
@else
else is also not here.
@endif
@undef FOO
@ifdef FOO
excluded now because it's undef
@else
I'm here, FOO is no longer defined
@endif
